Non scale victories have been the best for me like wearing a size XL for the first time since middle school (I’m 26), donating clothes bc they’re too big rather than too small, being able to buckle an airplane seatbelt and TIGHTEN it. \n\nThe body dysmorphia is so real, and I’m struggling with it a lot. I find it really hard to look at myself in the mirror and see me now, rather than me then. But we’re working on it!",

Non scale victories have been the best for me like wearing a size XL for the first time since middle school (I’m 26), donating clothes bc they’re too big rather than too small, being able to buckle an airplane seatbelt and TIGHTEN it. </p>\n\n<p>The body dysmorphia is so real, and I’m struggling with it a lot.

I wasn’t tracking, I was eating and drinking too much and I gained a few kgs. \n\nNow I have increased my dose back up to 1.2 where it is financially comfortable at the moment and I’m tracking again I have gotten the gain off and a further couple of kgs to my now lowest weight. \n\nIf you had told me a year ago I still wouldn’t be at goal I would have been gutted, however I am very close, I look and feel significantly different, my relationship with food is completely different. This has been life changing. It still takes hard work to loose, I believe I will absolutely gain it all back if I come off the medication so I do plan to stay on it long term, hopefully at .6 once I reach my goal. \n\n",

It’s been almost 6 months since starting Saxenda and there are things that have changed:\n\n-I don’t exercise as much as I used to in the beginning, maybe once or twice a week, but I do walk more (than I used to), about 6 steps per day on average. \n\n-Some weeks the scale goes up a little or it doesn’t move much, but eventually it goes down :) not as fast, slow and steady.\n\n-I’m on 1.8 and have been for a while, it has worked out fine for me. I do not take decisions on my own, I keep showing up to my follow-up appointments with both my nutritionist and dietitian.\n\n-As far as food, some days food noise is there and Ive noticed that even if my body feels full, my brain can’t stop thinking about binging. I haven’t and that feels great. I think that is because I’ve been going to therapy during this whole process, which I now realize is the most challenging thing, because I’ve been sharing and facing things I have been avoiding for years. \n\nAbout 38 kg/83 lbs down! It’s a good feeling when the scale goes down, but a GREAT feeling to be able to move more and do things with my body I thought I couldn’t. \n\nEverybody’s journey is different, so I wish you all the best!!

    "title": "My nausea advice - What I've learnt on Saxenda 9 months and 50kg down - Mounjaro swap",
    "body": "Hi, last year I've been on extreme weight loss and have **lost almost 60kg** and am about to reach optimal weight soon. I'm 28 years old and have a fully clean blood test. I do about a 1200kcal deficit daily, with a protein shake and multivitamins.\n\nI did 6 months of Saxenda 3mg; and now 3 months of Mounjaro 5mg.\n\nAmong bad food habits, I had pretty bad hypothyroidism with masses on my thyroid so the endocronologist gave me Saxenda to help me deal with weight.\n\nI have gerd - causing all the nausea related side effects to be amplified - both the entrance to my stomach and the exit towards my colon are not closing properly. Due to this I've went to ER twice during my stay on Saxenda due to extreme puking.\n\nBefore Saxenda, I've had almost 0 issues with my gerd, some morning burps here and there.\n\nThat being said, I don't regret a second of it.\n___\n***NOT A DOCTOR - personal experience combined with talking to a lot of doctors***\n#Nausea\nI've had two types of nausea:\n\n*  Getting adjusted to higher dose - usually resolves on its own\n*  Reactive to food - stayed\n\n\"Is my extreme nausea normal?\" - it can be but still talk to a doctor - my first night on 3mg Saxenda I was puking and shaking on my couch praying to god at 5AM - it happens - I didn't take saxenda for 2 days then lowered my dose back to 2.4mg for a bit until I \"needed more\".\n___\n#My Solutions:\n\n##**1. Food you intake is extremely important - digestion time and by-products - gasses and proteins**\n\n##Your goal is to not have specific foods simmer in your stomach for too long - this means smaller portions and thinking about food type\n\n**Animal fats are the worst** since not only do they digest slowly - they heavily produce sulphur gas getting you bloated and nauseous.\n\n**Protein intake is extremely important on a high calorie deficit diet to not lose muscle and to have energy while effectively starving your body - but protein digests very slowly and most protein produces some sulphur as a by-product.**\n\nVegetables and lean meat are very helpful but getting your required daily protein purely from meat might make you very sick due to the time it takes to digest. Due to that -\n\n**I heavily advise people to try whey protein shakes - whey is the FASTEST protein to digest and will help you stay more healthy - you can make a tasty chocolate shake thats barely 150kcal and gives you 30g of protein - three times more calorie efficient than a beef tenderloin steak**\n\nI had a bad day where I ate two fatty 400cal cheeseburgers.  Full 24 hours later I puked parts of the burger out since it still didnt digest.\nI ordered lean patties at my butcher and had almost no issues since. Same with lean beef tenderloin steaks - cause very very low nausea even when I eat 800kcal at once compared to a single mcdonalds cheeseburger.\n\nKeep the food protein rich and lean, if you want to fry things air fry, avoid making things fatty and oily.\n\n#2. Water intake helps digestion - lowers nausea.\nOne of the side effects of GLP drugs is that people start drinking less - be aware of it, don't get kidney stones or gout. Buy a water bottle with a straw lid and sip, it will help you a lot. \n\n#3. Meds (still not a doctor)\n\nOver the counter:\n\n* Ginger ale or tea\n* Bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol)\n* Antacids\n\nTalk to your doctor:\n\n* Ondansetron (Zofran)\n* PPI (Controloc)\n\nUnrelated to nausea - look into multivitamins, very cheap and can save you troubles\n\n#4. Swap to Mounjaro/Wegovy - please look into it\n\nFirstly and most importantly - if liraglutide is all you can access or afford - do not be disheartened - it has changed my life and the only regret was not starting it earlier.\n\n**Secondly - I really regret not swapping to Mounjaro earlier.** After 5 months I started getting more and more hungry even at the highest Saxenda dose - while still having a lot of side effects. I couldn't do exercise due to permanent bloating making me want to puke.\n\nMounjaro according to studies has about three times less people reporting nausea - and works MUCH more effectively. I'm on the 2nd lowest dose of mounjaro of 5mg for 3 months now and feel even less hungry and didn't puke once. I went from losing 0.8-1kg/week to 1.5-2kg/week without modifying my diet and feeling much better. Some nausea here and there but I can exercise and do things again.\n\nIn my EU countries capped prices: 3 Saxenda pens in 18 days at 3mg for €130 - averaging €220 a month.\n\nOne 5mg Mounjaro pen is 4 weekly doses (but many extract a 5th with a syringe) - costs €260 - meaning with 5th dose taken out €208 a month.\n___\n\nPersonal wish:\nTell others if it has helped you - inform your health care representatives and ask them about capping drugs or importing newer drugs. For example, even America pays $200 billion yearly due to obesity related medicare and loss of productivity - about $122 monthly per obese person. My dad just had a open heart surgery and he's not alone, obesity sucks. Maybe instead of heart surgeries, back surgeries, blood clot treatments and other, we can make the world a happier place by supporting GLP drugs to be more accessible monetarily and socially.",

      "selftext": "Hi, last year I've been on extreme weight loss and have **lost almost 60kg** and am about to reach optimal weight soon. I'm 28 years old and have a fully clean blood test. I do about a 1200kcal deficit daily, with a protein shake and multivitamins.\n\nI did 6 months of Saxenda 3mg; and now 3 months of Mounjaro 5mg.\n\nAmong bad food habits, I had pretty bad hypothyroidism with masses on my thyroid so the endocronologist gave me Saxenda to help me deal with weight.\n\nI have gerd - causing all the nausea related side effects to be amplified - both the entrance to my stomach and the exit towards my colon are not closing properly. Due to this I've went to ER twice during my stay on Saxenda due to extreme puking.\n\nBefore Saxenda, I've had almost 0 issues with my gerd, some morning burps here and there.\n\nThat being said, I don't regret a second of it.\n___\n***NOT A DOCTOR - personal experience combined with talking to a lot of doctors***\n#Nausea\nI've had two types of nausea:\n\n*  Getting adjusted to higher dose - usually resolves on its own\n*  Reactive to food - stayed\n\n\"Is my extreme nausea normal?\" - it can be but still talk to a doctor - my first night on 3mg Saxenda I was puking and shaking on my couch praying to god at 5AM - it happens - I didn't take saxenda for 2 days then lowered my dose back to 2.4mg for a bit until I \"needed more\".\n___\n#My Solutions:\n\n##**1. Food you intake is extremely important - digestion time and by-products - gasses and proteins**\n\n##Your goal is to not have specific foods simmer in your stomach for too long - this means smaller portions and thinking about food type\n\n**Animal fats are the worst** since not only do they digest slowly - they heavily produce sulphur gas getting you bloated and nauseous.\n\n**Protein intake is extremely important on a high calorie deficit diet to not lose muscle and to have energy while effectively starving your body - but protein digests very slowly and most protein produces some sulphur as a by-product.**\n\nVegetables and lean meat are very helpful but getting your required daily protein purely from meat might make you very sick due to the time it takes to digest. Due to that -\n\n**I heavily advise people to try whey protein shakes - whey is the FASTEST protein to digest and will help you stay more healthy - you can make a tasty chocolate shake thats barely 150kcal and gives you 30g of protein - three times more calorie efficient than a beef tenderloin steak**\n\nI had a bad day where I ate two fatty 400cal cheeseburgers.  Full 24 hours later I puked parts of the burger out since it still didnt digest.\nI ordered lean patties at my butcher and had almost no issues since. Same with lean beef tenderloin steaks - cause very very low nausea even when I eat 800kcal at once compared to a single mcdonalds cheeseburger.\n\nKeep the food protein rich and lean, if you want to fry things air fry, avoid making things fatty and oily.\n\n#2. Water intake helps digestion - lowers nausea.\nOne of the side effects of GLP drugs is that people start drinking less - be aware of it, don't get kidney stones or gout. Buy a water bottle with a straw lid and sip, it will help you a lot. \n\n#3. Meds (still not a doctor)\n\nOver the counter:\n\n* Ginger ale or tea\n* Bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol)\n* Antacids\n\nTalk to your doctor:\n\n* Ondansetron (Zofran)\n* PPI (Controloc)\n\nUnrelated to nausea - look into multivitamins, very cheap and can save you troubles\n\n#4. Swap to Mounjaro/Wegovy - please look into it\n\nFirstly and most importantly - if liraglutide is all you can access or afford - do not be disheartened - it has changed my life and the only regret was not starting it earlier.\n\n**Secondly - I really regret not swapping to Mounjaro earlier.** After 5 months I started getting more and more hungry even at the highest Saxenda dose - while still having a lot of side effects. I couldn't do exercise due to permanent bloating making me want to puke.\n\nMounjaro according to studies has about three times less people reporting nausea - and works MUCH more effectively. I'm on the 2nd lowest dose of mounjaro of 5mg for 3 months now and feel even less hungry and didn't puke once. I went from losing 0.8-1kg/week to 1.5-2kg/week without modifying my diet and feeling much better. Some nausea here and there but I can exercise and do things again.\n\nIn my EU countries capped prices: 3 Saxenda pens in 18 days at 3mg for €130 - averaging €220 a month.\n\nOne 5mg Mounjaro pen is 4 weekly doses (but many extract a 5th with a syringe) - costs €260 - meaning with 5th dose taken out €208 a month.\n___\n\nPersonal wish:\nTell others if it has helped you - inform your health care representatives and ask them about capping drugs or importing newer drugs. For example, even America pays $200 billion yearly due to obesity related medicare and loss of productivity - about $122 monthly per obese person. My dad just had a open heart surgery and he's not alone, obesity sucks. Maybe instead of heart surgeries, back surgeries, blood clot treatments and other, we can make the world a happier place by supporting GLP drugs to be more accessible monetarily and socially.",

I have been on saxenda for 3 months now, my dosage is 1.2 + 5 clicks, as discussed and recommended by my doctor. I just wanted to come here to say that this really has changed everything for me. \n\nFood noise comes and goes now, but I have been able to manage it and haven’t binged since I started the medication! I watched a video of someone on a GLP-1 medication a couple of weeks ago and she said something that meant a lot. I went along the lines of: “If I feel like I WANT to keep eating even though I am not hungry, I say to myself that I can eat this in 5 minutes. In an hour. In two or three hours. So I just wait 5 minutes.” And for me, it has worked. If I feel anxious to eat more when I already am full, I wait 5 minutes. Of course it isn’t magic but it helps :) \n\nI am not swimming anymore because I’m working a new job and I can’t work my schedule to fit into the pool hours, but I am walking more than I used to (about 6k steps per day) and exercising at home 2 to 4 times a week, I am doing a routine that a training coach made for me. \n\nI really hope everyone’s journey it’s going well, and in case someone wants to share experiences I am here for it. It isn’t easy to talk about this with my circle because most of my friends or family haven’t experienced being overweight for their entire lives, and sometimes that can feel…lonely. So I appreciate reading testimonies here, and that’s why I am posting. \n\nGood luck with your journeys!\n\n",

I've lost around 42 lbs, and I'm the lightest I've been since my first year of college (I'm 25 now). I still have a ways to go to hit my goal, but I'm much more confident in myself and my body, I've lost fat in my face, I sleep better, and I have more energy. I've been building up my strength and endurance at the gym, and I went from being able to run 1.5 miles to 8 miles, 270 lbs on the leg press, and deadlifting 155 lbs. I'll be running my first 10k race next month. My eating habits are much healthier, the food noise is gone, and I've pretty much stopped binge eating and stress eating. My PCOS symptoms are much more under control. Other people (notably, my family) have noticed my efforts, which has boosted my confidence so much. So don't lose hope!!",

    "title": "1 year on Saxenda and I’m the happiest I’ve ever been",
    "body": "I was so inspired by this sub at the very beginning of my journey so I wanted to share my own success story, 1 year on.\n\n**My stats**\n\nF / 26 yo / 5”0’ \n- Starting weight: 65 kg (143.3 lbs)\n- Current weight: 54 kg (121 lbs)\n\nTotal weight loss is equivalent to 15% of my body weight!\n\n**My journey**\n\nI have always had a history of bouncing between an extreme low calorie diet and then bingeing. Whether I was gaining or losing weight, I was always thinking about food to the point where it disrupted my life. I couldn’t keep any sweet or savoury snacks around because I was *hyper*aware of their existence and would eventually cave and eat them. \n\nEven more frustrating was the fact that I was an active person, and loved (still do!) powerlifting competitively. I truly felt like I was trapped in a body that never reflected the work I put in.\n\nIn Feb 2024 I finally started researching weight loss aids and decided on Saxenda, which I was prescribed through an online pharmacy (Australia). The process was easy, albeit expensive coming in at around ~$550 AUD for 5 pens.\n\nMy god, that first week on Saxenda changed everything. I was staring at food and just could not fathom eating it. The only time that I even thought of food was when I was hungry, and as soon as I was full, I would stop eating (even if there was still food on the plate!). No shift in “willpower” or “discipline,” just my body finally responding correctly in line with my hunger signals! I finally understood how naturally slim people felt and what goes on in their brains. It was nothing short of a miracle for me.\n\nI count calories on MyFitnessPal but can usually stick to my daily intake quite easily. Some days I even have to make sure I’m eating enough!\n\nI usually take a 0.6 mg dose and sometimes increase it to 1.2 mg if I feel effects waning. I am a very petite person so this dosage works for me, and is an added benefit since it is very expensive. \n\n**Side effects**\n\nNausea, constipation and bloating within the first 3-4 days of starting or upping my dose. \n\n**Maintenance**\n\nI am planning to continue to take 0.6 mg for the foreseeable future, even once I start maintaining my weight. It will cost me about ~$1200 - $1500 AUD a year to do so and for me that is worth every cent. There is talk of the medication becoming generic in Australia soon so I will also hold out hope for that!\n\nOut of interest, I went off Saxenda for a month to go on holiday and I still felt in control of my eating and much more in tune with my hunger signals. I was surprised to see that even with eating to satiety, I didn’t gain any weight in that month. \n\n**Other things I noticed**\n\nJust out of interest, some other things I found interesting \n- You will get mixed responses from telling people you’re on the drug. I find it hilarious when naturally slim people tell me “just watch what I eat” instead. I mostly keep it to myself now. \n- I found the 3/3/3 rule really REALLY applied to weight loss: in 3 days you with feel a difference, in 3 weeks you will see it, in 3 months you will hear it!\n- NSV: my keratosis pilaris (chicken skin) disappeared completely from my arms after losing the first 5 kg.\n- Some days I feel like I look in the mirror and look the exact same as when I started. Not true! Taking progress photos has really help me see a difference when I feel this way. Also some days you will be bloated/constipated/holding water weight and that is okay — just be patient. \n- Saxenda may not work for you. There’s so many other options out there. I had family swap to Zepbound from Saxenda and that ended up being their miracle drug.\n- Be prepared for a lot of people to chat to you about your weight. It’s funny seeing people trying to figure out what to say, from *you look well* to *wow you lost a bunch of weight* haha! When people ask how I lost the weight I just tell them “I’m staying active, eating healthy and keeping my hormones in check.”\n\nHoping to lose a bit more weight so I can see muscle definition, especially my abs (never thought I would say that!). In saying that, I am stoked with my current weight and would be happy if I stayed exactly where I am.\n\n",

Also some days you will be bloated/constipated/holding water weight and that is okay — just be patient. \n- Saxenda may not work for you. There’s so many other options out there. I had family swap to Zepbound from Saxenda and that ended up being their miracle drug.\n- Be prepared for a lot of people to chat to you about your weight. It’s funny seeing people trying to figure out what to say, from <em>you look well</em> to <em>wow you lost a bunch of weight</em> haha! When people ask how I lost the weight I just tell them “I’m staying active, eating healthy and keeping my hormones in check.”</p>\n\n<p>Hoping to lose a bit more weight so I can see muscle definition, especially my abs (never thought I would say that!). In saying that, I am stoked with my current weight and would be happy if I stayed exactly where I am.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

My starting weight was 137 kg/302 lbs. \n\nI’ve been following the eating plan (1600 cals per day) my nutritionist gave me and swimming 2 to 3 times a week. I work as a cashier so I don’t walk a lot, I’ll try to make more steps this month but I’m feeling positive about this :) \n\nI was scared before starting Saxenda fearing that food noise wouldn’t go away but it did. Ngl, some days I find myself thinking about binging but it goes away fairly quickly, swimming has helped a lot with my anxiety.\n\nAs an advice, the first couple of days I would feel mild nausea in the mornings (I inject at night) so I’d avoid eating thinking it would help. I was wrong. Later on I learned that I have to it, if I don’t have a big appetite I try to have at least a yogurt and haven’t felt nauseous since! \n\nI hope everything goes well for everyone! ❤️",

I started at 247lbs (may 10) and weighed in this morning at 232.6. I’ve been going to the gym consistently and eating well, just feeling better over all. I haven’t struggled with side effects so far with the exception of some mild nausea, and I’ve been taking my time increasing my dose (I just increased to 2.4). I’m just so happy with how it’s going!!!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

It's been working really well for me so far, I've had next to no side effects and am on the full 3.0 mg dose.\n\nI've been losing weight daily steadily - had some big drops in the first couple weeks. And now it's evened out to more like 1 lb/week or so.\n\nJust thought I'd share my progress for anyone looking into this medication! \n\nI was a bit nervous about daily injection, and initially was approved from the Dr for Wegovy but it's under review by my insurance company until September so they won't approve it while it's under review. Saxenda is covered under my plan though.\n\nCurious how long the full dose worked for other people. I noticed when I was titrating up that the lower dose would work for 1-2 weeks before I felt the effects of it were decreased. So I'm wondering if the same will happen at the full dose. Currently have been on the full dose for 2.5 weeks.\n\n",

    "title": "10KG Down!! Saxenda update",
    "body": "SW: 86kg\nCW: 76kg\nGW: 65kg\n\nA long awaited update on my saxenda journey. Starting Jan 2025 I’ve been super consistent with my diet, workouts and injections. \n\nA little background on my journey, I started this medication in Aug 2024 and was consistently for 1 month and saw good progress ( from 86kg  to 80kg) however between September to December I have been inconsistent with the injection hence no weight loss occurred. During those month I did take the injections here and there and not completely stop. I didn’t really gain much weight here and pretty much was fluctuating between 80-82KG. \n\nI only really started losing back the weight this year once I started being very consistent with the injections as well as working out and diet. \n\nI have been eating super clean lately with cheat meals only once in two weeks. Tbh I’m not super strict with it but I can tell my discipline has changed a lot hence it’s not hard for me to avoid bad foods. \nMain thing on my diet is not eating processed foods food at all. So a lot of eggs, chicken and wraps!\n\nI do crave my junk foods but when I do buy them to treat myself I can never find myself to finish it cause of the medication curbing my appetite. So even when I  treat myself, it’s all in moderation.\n\nAs for workouts, I’ve been doing 10k steps everyday. That’s pretty much it but I saw such a high difference when I do and don’t. I lost weight faster when I incorporate working out.\n\n\nSide effects?\n\nHAIR LOSS !!\n\nI’m not surprised cause the previous time I lost weight 5 years back I lost a lot of hair as well. I know it’s inevitable and I’m looking at other alternative to help my hair situation. \n\nOverall I’m very happy with my progress and I’m certain I can hit 65kg by April 2025. Wish me luck!\n\n",

I started Saxenda last October and had a rough first two months but then the symptoms went away and between October - May I lost 56 lbs going from 264 - 208. In May I started to feel like it wasn’t working like it had and started to get the food noise and cravings that I hadn’t had in months. \n\nIn June I got Covid and felt crappy and didn’t feel like adding injections into the mix. I was then off Saxenda from June - August because I felt like I wanted to give my body a bit of a break. I gained 14 pounds (too much summer fun). 🤦🏻‍♀️\n\nStarted Saxenda again around the third week in August and it was weird, I felt nothing. I actually went up to 3.0 fairly quickly and still wasn’t feeling much difference. I was wondering if it was just no longer going to work for me. Then oddly enough after about a month it “kicked in”. Food noise went away, cravings have calmed down, appetite is down. I have lost 6 of the pounds I out back on. So all of this to say, stick with it. Time and patience isn’t easy and it’s a marathon not a sprint. Now just hoping this continues and I can get under 200 for the first time in a very long time. ",

So any weight gain is kind of dangerous to me. I’ve actually recently been diagnosed with Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT)  due to it as of recently. \nI had a really good start with Zepbound , and the weight loss was noticeable. Then my insurance decided not to cover it a month in, and I was switched to Saxenda. \nThe changes in weight and visually haven’t been impactful, and that can at times be very disappointing. The food noise is there but not as strong. (Unlike Zepbound where I had to force myself to eat)  but my vitals and bmi show a dramatic difference. And I am happy about that so far. I just wanted to share them with people who would understand lol.\nAlso, did anyone else have a slow journey with Saxenda? </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

    "body": "Yesterday was day 15 on liraglutide, day 7 on 1.2mg.  Appetite is slightly decreased, but the biggest change I've noticed this week is the lack of food noise and lack of desire to binge, and that's what I need help with the most.  I am absolutely stoked at how well this is working, and with minimal to no side effects. \n\nI mean, I don't think I can adequately verbalize how incredible the lack of desire to binge really is.  There are unopened boxes of cookies in my house that I'm not having to hide in the trunk of the car to avoid eating.  There are opened bags of Christmas truffles *that still contain truffles*!  There's most of a cheesecake in the 'fridge that isn't constantly calling my name.   I'm able to eat reasonable portions of desserts.  Shoot, I stopped eating a piece of pizza the other night because I was full (it was the third large piece, but pre-liraglutide me would definitely have finished it and wanted more).  I can eat a single serving of potato chips and not be tempted to finish the entire bag. \n\nI'm scheduled to titrate up to 1.8mg tomorrow, but I think I'm going to stay at 1.2 a bit longer.  I don't want to risk further decreased appetite or increased side effects.  \n\n**Some stats and history for reference:** \n\n* 49F, 5'2\". PCOS, insulin resistance, pre-diabetes, high cholesterol. \n* 2022-2023, lost almost 90lbs (starting weight: 274, lowest weight: 185) just counting calories.  Had the occasional binge, but was able to consistently maintain a moderate calorie deficit. Pre-diabetes and high cholesterol completely resolved, all labs normal.  \n* 2024 has been a particularly crappy year, and stress has caused my binge eating to flare up in a major way.  Between Feb and Dec 2024, I regained 40lbs and am now back up to 225.  Pre-diabetes and high cholesterol are back.  \n* My overall eating habits are good (calorie friendly and nutritionally balanced meals and snacks, everything logged and tracked); but binging on junk food multiple times a week overrides any calorie deficit and puts me in a surplus.\n\nWhen I mentioned binge eating to my psychiatrist, he suggested a GLP-1. His first suggestion was tirzepatide, then compounded semaglutide, but he was willing to humor my preference for liraglutide with the warning that it's on average less effective than the once weekly versions.  \n\nIt's still early on in my GLP-1 journey, and I may very well end up having to admit that he was right and switch to one of the other GLP-1s, but for now, I'm sticking with this for as long as it works and as long as the side effects are tolerable.  \n\n**Random factors:**  I still log foods and calories daily to make sure I'm not over **or** under eating.  I haven't had any real weight loss to speak of yet, but it's only been 2 weeks with some big food holidays in there.  I also didn't have the decreased appetite/decreased binging until recently, and did have some calorie surplus days while on the 0.6mg dose.  ",

Last summer when I saw 97kg on the scale I completely broke down cause I suffer from weight blindness and couldn't see how much I had actually gained. From August 2024 to March 2025 I lost 10 kg naturally, whilst thats amazing and I'm around 86-87kg, I haven't been able to lose anymore I cut down my calories, focused on whole foods and increased exercise, so I decided to go on Saxenda just to give me that added boost, I have always struggled with food noise and had binge eating disorder and I really just want to repair my relationship with food. My main concern is I will lose the weight on Saxenda and when I stop I will gain it all back, I don't want to be reliant on medication my whole life. Also if anyone has any tips about the diet and lifestyle changes they made on saxenda to maximise results that would be greatly appreciated,\n\nOverall I'm really excited for my journey to start😊",

For the first time on the medication, I felt so sick and was vomiting for a whole day. \n\nI decided to lower to does to 1.2 and it worked. I was back to having suppressed appetite. I’ve continued at this dose for the past 2 weeks and I’ve found it effective. \n\nDuring my break I did gain weight, roughly around 2kg but I do think it’s because of excessive eating during my birthday which I’m responsible for and I made that decision with expectations of gaining slight weight. \n\nNow that I’ve started back on the medication, everything has been smooth and I’ve officially hit 80kg exactly. This means I’ve lost a total of 6kg in a span of 2 months. \n\nI would have lost more if it wasn’t for the break which makes me hopefully for the next 3 months of the year.\n\nI’ve shared this to mainly share light on taking smaller doses after breaks and also to give hope to those who haven’t seen weight loss. This really does work and the food noise is completely gone. \n\nMy only concern now is that I’m under eating, I’m worried of the consequences such as hair loss which I’ve experience a couple years back when I lost 12KG ( this was due to working conditions and not on any medication). \n\n\nI’ve been eating 1 meals a day plus another small meal/ snack which I try to eat clean as much as I can but I’m not super strict on the number of calories. \n\nMy main goal is to stop ordering out which has been pretty successful and I only eat out 1 or 2 meal a week in comparison to ordering around 10-12 times a week previously.

For the first time on the medication, I felt so sick and was vomiting for a whole day. </p>\n\n<p>I decided to lower to does to 1.2 and it worked. I was back to having suppressed appetite. I’ve continued at this dose for the past 2 weeks and I’ve found it effective. </p>\n\n<p>During my break I did gain weight, roughly around 2kg but I do think it’s because of excessive eating during my birthday which I’m responsible for and I made that decision with expectations of gaining slight weight. </p>\n\n<p>Now that I’ve started back on the medication, everything has been smooth and I’ve officially hit 80kg exactly. This means I’ve lost a total of 6kg in a span of 2 months. </p>\n\n<p>I would have lost more if it wasn’t for the break which makes me hopefully for the next 3 months of the year.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve shared this to mainly share light on taking smaller doses after breaks and also to give hope to those who haven’t seen weight loss. This really does work and the food noise is completely gone. </p>\n\n<p>My only concern now is that I’m under eating, I’m worried of the consequences such as hair loss which I’ve experience a couple years back when I lost 12KG ( this was due to working conditions and not on any medication). </p>\n\n<p>I’ve been eating 1 meals a day plus another small meal/ snack which I try to eat clean as much as I can but I’m not super strict on the number of calories. </p>\n\n<p>My main goal is to stop ordering out which has been pretty successful and I only eat out 1 or 2 meal a week in comparison to ordering around 10-12 times a week previously. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

    "body": "Enjoy reading people’s experiences here good and bad so thought I would post mine too after taking Saxenda for 7 weeks.\n\nWeight: Starting weight was 311lbs, current weight is 282lbs so have lost 29 lbs so far.\n\nDosage: Always had the intention of using the minimum amount of the drug as possible- mainly due to the cost of it which I have to pay the full amount for. But I soon found that when taking the lower doses that the weight loss would stall and the hunger would return. No point in, for example, not losing weight on 1.2 as it is a waste when I can go up to 1.8 and start losing  again. Currently up to the 3.0 maximum level and so far so good on that- hopefully weight loss doesn’t stall.\n\nSide Effects: I had very little side effects at all until I started on 2.4 when I got nausea and generally felt a bit off for the first week on it. Stayed on it for a second week to get used to it but didn’t lose anything so moved up to 3.0 with no issues so far.\n\nEating: no issues with hunger apart from when I stayed on lower doses for too long. \nI’ve eaten healthily the entire time, eating low calorie balanced meals and tried to get in extra protein wherever possible. \nI’ve found on the higher doses if I go too long without food my energy levels can drop quite quickly- I carry a snack with me for those times, fruit or low calorie bars to get me through to meal time.\nIt’s hard to explain how I feel when eating- best way to describe it is I’m not hungry at all but I’m happy to give my body what it needs to top up my “battery” back to 100%. I never really keep eating beyond that. Does anyone else see it that way? Might be strange I don’t know. \nI used to be a bottomless pit when eating so it is strange to me!\n\nExercise: walking, running (up to about 4km without stopping now), cross trainer, rowing machine and some light dumbbells for muscle tone. \nAt the start I was doing 5 to 6 days a week, mixing it up, and was enjoying it but I’ve cut that down to 3 to 4 days as I think it was slowing the weight loss, which is the main goal.\n\nSummary: so far so good, results have been amazing as I have always struggled to shift any weight. Side effects are minimal, I just have to manage my energy levels- for me this is the key thing.\nI’ll keep going for another two months and then will have to review things financially. If I could lose another 15 to 20lbs in that time it would be great.\n \nGood luck to everyone on here. This is a hard thing to do. 👍",

    "title": "After one one month on Zepbound I had to switch to saxenda. I am currently on week two of saxenda and here is my honest review",
    "body": "Since starting my journey in January, I am down from a Start weight of 245, to 227.6 \nThat’s about 2.25 lb a week. \nI’m actually quite shocked.\nI want to preface and say I lost atleast 10-12 lb on Zepbound first. But … BUT . I was extremely sick every week for one to two days after taking my injection. And I was ALWAYS freezing. (Like shaking a lot ) \n The side effects are much less severe for me on saxenda, I did get constipation the first week. But I drank an entire bottle of magnesium citrate .. (yeah lol don’t do that unless it is absolutely essential)🤣 TMI but  I peed out of butt for like two full days🤣\nBut now I feel Fine. I have a little metal mouth with Saxenda, but I also had this with Zepbound. And I also have injection site redness with Saxenda , but it’s most likely human error that has caused this. I’m a bit heavy handed in literally everything I do lol.\nAll around, I was very unhappy to make the switch (after the fact) It didn’t get IMMEDIATE results of loss of food noise with saxenda. It was a gradual build up that is still building up. But to be extremely honest, this medicine is much less harsh on my body. And I’m extremely happy to of switched now. \nAs for my diet: I have always been a pretty healthy eater. I’m actually on Facebook and have accrued well\nOver 130k followers that really rely on me for my herbalist lifestyle and writing on sustainability . So for me to be gaining weight and struggling the way I was, just wasn’t adding up. After all the blood work  I did , we found out I have a heart issue and PCOS / borderline diabetic . And these three things were really effecting how things worked inside me. I don’t want to say anything is a miracle drug, because normally I don’t rely on drugs to help me. And this has changed my life for the better. I am so thankful to have this, and a community on Reddit to be able to learn from. \nSorry if this is just a run on rant. But I’m exceptionally happy with my outcome so far and have no one to share it with .. yet.\n",

    "body": "I am not making this post to scare anyone.\nBut I was so stessed out myself not finding any information so my hope is that anyone experiencing the same I did might find some comfort in this post.\n\nSo I started Saxenda desember 2022. In the end of january 2023 I had a few episodes with flashes of light in my side vision. It wasn't often, but enough to scare me enough to see an eye doctor. He didn't find anything wrong.\n\nIn may I found my vision on my left eye not beeing as good as usual so I booked an appointment with my optician for a new test so we could adjust my strength in lenses and get new updated glasses. She was horrified. My eyesight was the same, but I had signs of cataracts. I'm way to young to get cataracts... She sent me back to the eyedoctor. It started out as a few blurry spots, but it got worse really fast, to the point where my left eye was just blurry with a few clear spots here and there. \n\nI've been in and out from my eye doctors office for almost a year. He did not know what was wrong. I had the same blurry spots as with cataracts, but it wasn't that. He theorised I'd had a undiscovered blood cloth in my eye, he then theorised I'd had an infection in my eye that I didn't notice. He was really confused and we never landed on anyting. After a few months of no changes he set me up for regular check ups. I was calling out saxenda the whole time, but everyone said it wasn't it because they'd never heard of anyone experiencing this on the drug.\n\nI stopped saxenda in may, and now, almost 6 months later, my eyesight is back to normal. I couldn't read using only my left eye at the worst, it was just a bunch of blurry dots. Now I see perfectly fine on that eye. The only thing that has changed is going of saxenda. My eye doctor is now agreeing with me, after having an other patient with the same issue, also beeing on Saxenda. He said he'd urged the patient to quit the drug, but they won't know for a while if there is a connection. My doctor at the obesity clinic still belive it's a coincidence, but he said he'd bring it up to his colleagues attention just in case. I have reported it as a side effect.\n\n\nSo, if you experience any vision changed on this drug, REPORT IT. It might be a really rare side effect, but they won't know if no one reports it. And please, take your eyesight serious, get any abnormalities and changes checked up!",

My eye doctor is now agreeing with me, after having an other patient with the same issue, also beeing on Saxenda. He said he&#39;d urged the patient to quit the drug, but they won&#39;t know for a while if there is a connection. My doctor at the obesity clinic still belive it&#39;s a coincidence, but he said he&#39;d bring it up to his colleagues attention just in case. I have reported it as a side effect.</p>\n\n<p>So, if you experience any vision changed on this drug, REPORT IT. It might be a really rare side effect, but they won&#39;t know if no one reports it. And please, take your eyesight serious, get any abnormalities and changes checked up!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

Started the week with 99.5kg and finished with 97.7kg, I know most of it it’s water but looks like a good start.\n\nIn terms of side effects I felt nausea, bloated on the first 2 days, but after that not much. No constipation either. Unfortunately I got a strep infection and felt a lot of fever over the weekend, I was asking myself if this is Saxenda side effects I am not sure if I can handle it, luckily that wasn’t the case.\n\nI am eating a lot of proteins: tuna, salmon and eggs, along controller portions of rice, beans, salad, fruits and veggies.\n\nI can’t wait for the sore throat infection go away so I can start the gym.\n\nI think the biggest difference is control, before Saxenda If I bought a bag of 6 oranges in the evening, in the morning I would have eaten all of them, now I can have one orange a day. Even dark chocolate, I would eat 4+ tablets of Lindt in one shot, now I eat half tablet (or 0) in a day and don’t feel the need for more 💪. \n\nFeel free to ask me any question…\n",

    "body": "Hi everyone! \n\nI’ve been on Saxenda for almost 3 months now, started on 24 October 2024. \n\nHeight: 164.4cm \nStarting weight: 85.1kg\nGoal weight: 55kg (as recommended by my doctor) \nCurrent weight: 77kg\n\nMy dosages (as prescribed by my doctor): \n24/10-31/10: 0.6mg, down to 85kg\n01-07/11: 1.2mg, down to 83.6kg\n08-21/11: 1.8mg, down to 80kg\n21/11-05/12: 2.4mg, down to 78.6kg\n06/12-1/1/2025: 3mg, down to 77kg \nI’m now on 2.4mg from 02/01/2025-16/02/2025. \n\nThis whole time I was eating around 1200cal daily, at least 6000 steps daily. However, I didn’t sleep very well, my stomach was often upset, I vomited once or twice on 3mg (hence the dosage decrease).\n\nThough that’s being said, I feel so much lighter, my knees and ankles feel sooo free! My clothes are getting bigger on me too! \n\nAs of now, I’m not losing as much as I would like (at least 1-2kg per week), I’m afraid I might have hit plateau. I’m trying to increase my steps to 10K daily, still maintain my calorie intake because I feel like if I eat less, I will be too tired to do anything. My doctor recommends increasing protein intake and going to the gym to do weight lifting, I’ll consider it but I can’t help feeling exhausted all the time.
