As I get closer to goal, my TDEE will drop. The numbers will slow down, or stall, and I’ll have to keep pushing even when it feels pointless. \n\nBut even if I reach goal, this phase of my life is never going to end. Not if I don’t want to gain back all 215 pounds.\n\nI’m going to spend every evening for the rest of my life talking myself out of junk food. \n\nI’m going to spend the rest of my life counting calories.\n\nI’m going to spend the rest of my life weighing every morsel that goes into me.\n\nI’m going to spend the rest of my life pouring over the menu trying to find the healthy option instead of just ordering what I really want.\n\nI’m going to spend the rest of my life fighting the voice in my head that tells me I deserve a treat. Or that just one day off won’t hurt. Or that “won’t it feel nice to feel truly full again? Just once?”\n\nThe rest of my life wrestling with the damage I’ve done to my body and my psyche that got me to become super morbidly obese in the first place. That monster in my head that can only feel at peace when it’s stuffed with junk food, and spends the rest of its waking hours trying to tempt me back into my old ways.\n\nI’m not even halfway to goal but I guess I thought at some point that voice was going to go away. That I could eventually make “normal” eating patterns my new normal. But it’s not and it never will be.\n\nAnd well, that sucks, and I don’t know if I have it in me to win every day for the rest of my life.\n\nBut I’m gonna try. For today anyway.\n\nEdit: I truly appreciate the support, but please, if you’re going to comment that I “just need to build new habits”, I’m begging you to understand that I haven’t been at this for just a week or a month. It’s been a year. I’ve lost over one HUNDRED pounds (45kg if you prefer). I have the habits; I habitually weigh all my food. I habitually track every calorie. I habitually go to bed still hungry, I habitually walk daily even when I’d rather stick my hand in a paper shredder. This is *not about habits,* if it was I’d be over it by now. It does not take this long to make new habits. I’m addicted to food and cannot change that. ",

Or that just one day off won’t hurt. Or that “won’t it feel nice to feel truly full again? Just once?”</p>\n\n<p>The rest of my life wrestling with the damage I’ve done to my body and my psyche that got me to become super morbidly obese in the first place. That monster in my head that can only feel at peace when it’s stuffed with junk food, and spends the rest of its waking hours trying to tempt me back into my old ways.</p>\n\n<p>I’m not even halfway to goal but I guess I thought at some point that voice was going to go away. That I could eventually make “normal” eating patterns my new normal. But it’s not and it never will be.</p>\n\n<p>And well, that sucks, and I don’t know if I have it in me to win every day for the rest of my life.</p>\n\n<p>But I’m gonna try. For today anyway.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I truly appreciate the support, but please, if you’re going to comment that I “just need to build new habits”, I’m begging you to understand that I haven’t been at this for just a week or a month. It’s been a year. I’ve lost over one HUNDRED pounds (45kg if you prefer). I have the habits; I habitually weigh all my food. I habitually track every calorie. I habitually go to bed still hungry, I habitually walk daily even when I’d rather stick my hand in a paper shredder. This is <em>not about habits,</em> if it was I’d be over it by now. It does not take this long to make new habits. I’m addicted to food and cannot change that. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

Being seen makes it easier to be kind and respectful towards your own body. If you need to be bullied into losing weight then that&#39;s a strong signal that you&#39;re deeply unwell. The issue is inside of you. Not in a Nike commercial. I can sympathise, I&#39;m not always kind to myself either. But get a grip.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, once in a while (literally once in a blue moon lol) I see fat people on social media (influencers, shall we say) having this &quot;I love my body so I don&#39;t wanna change it&quot; type of mindset. But that only means they&#39;re not quite there yet either, on their self-love journey. That shouldn&#39;t be a reason to be vocal about being so vocal and careless with critique of body positivity movement. </p>\n\n<p>Look what is happening among young people. Young women particularly. H3ro1n chic is coming at us again, a vile propaganda to keep us silent while government strips us off our rights. And you consider this less harmful that fat person saying that they don&#39;t plan on losing weight? Is it really a concern worth addressing right now?</p>\n\n<p>Internalised fatphobia on this level makes my tongue itch to ask if thin people have picked you yet. Give it some thought before eating me alive here, please (especially considering how fat I am bruh)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

I'm more embarrassed than upset right now, but I'm not sure where to direct the feeling.\n\nSo, LoseIt, I come to you asking for your best guides and routines to become healthy again. I'm currently using Gemini and the sidebar to learn about CICO and how to incorporate exercise as my current job leaves me sedentary at the desk most of the day.\n\nI'm currently 39 years old, 6' tall, and 356 pounds. My initial goals will be to lose 10 pounds by October 7, lose at least 30 pounds by December 31, better my relationship with food, and learn how to drown out food noise as I am a chronic snacker. Luckily I don't drink soda, but I do love my morning iced coffee during my drive to the office.\n\nI've downloaded the Lose It! app and found a coupon code for a lifetime membership and am considering getting a fitbit to help track steps, heart rate, etc. What have you all found useful in obtaining your goals?\n\nThanks much in advance, \n\nMeaty Hairy Sack of Oatmeal\n\nUpdate: Holy cow this got a lot bigger than I expected it to! Thank you all for the support, encouragement, and also for the harsh honesty that some folks provided. No, I'm not divorcing my wife. I love my family. From the advice that some of you provided I've gotten myself a good scale, downloaded the LoseIt! app for calorie tracking, and made a Costco run for some meal prep. How do I get flair?\n\nUpdate 2: For the folks messaging me comments about how my wife should be leaving me because of my weight  please stop. Yes, what she said was hurtful. Yes, I need to lose weight. I'm determined to work on both areas of myself.\n\nUpdate 3: I have decided that counting calories while practicing intermittent fasting will be my first steps. I've purchased a food scale and meal prep dishes and have planned my meals out for the week giving me 2,100 calories a day. I'm lucky enough to have access to a free gym and will be there 5 days a week on my lunch breaks. I'll be using my intermittent fasting time to work on myself by reading, listening to podcasts, and Journaling. Thank you again, everyone, for the immense support.",

Yes, I didn’t like how I looked but more than anything I hated how my weight stopped me from doing everyday things, and anything I did was so taxing. Walking up the stairs, running errands, things of that nature. \n\nI’ve struggled with endless weight gain and loss for several years now, but this time around I finally found the key (for me)! Daily movement, calorie counting, and cheating daily. I don’t have cheat days, I “cheat daily” so I always satisfy that feeling that would typically lead to binges. Another big thing is I don’t fixate on the number on the scale—I measure by pictures and clothing. \n\nI saw notices the first few months but most of my progress has occurred over the last 3, when I started incorporating low-impact exercises (walking 3 miles every day). In January, I noticed significant changes in energy and that’s when I decided to take up climbing! This has been my favorite part of my weight loss journey. Finally having the confidence and ability to do something I’ve always wanted to try. And I will say, I have noticed a difference in my core and arms already!  I eat anywhere from 1200-1800 calories a day. \n\nAlmost to my goal!",

    "title": "The amount of calories in food, I'm questioning my entire existence atp",
    "body": "This is gonna be a long post but I am literally in denial right now because of what I just read online. \n\nI have been extremely uncomfortable with my weight for over 2-3 years now and it was not until October 2024 I decided to really take my weight seriously. Since then I have only lost 1 kgs/2.2 lbs. Which is very little weight considering I have been in a kind of extreme diet since October. I did the OMAD diet for about 1.5 week before I realised that it did not fit my lifestyle. Then I switched to calorie counting. I did some online searching and saw that my body burns about 1.9k calories a day on it's own. Since I just wanted to get the weight off I started eating 1.2k calories max everyday which according to the online website it said that would make me drop 0.5kg/1.1 lbs each week. And on top of that calorie restriction, since January 1st I made it a new years resolution to eat less sugar, processed and junk food which I've been doing so good on. But I kept going on the scale every day and seeing I only dropped 1 kgs/2.2 lbs since October. That's almost 4 months ago which is about 16 weeks and according to the website I should be down 8kgs/17.6lbs. \n\nSo I went online and tried to figure out the reason. I saw many posts and websites say the same thing. ''You might be eating too many calories if you aren't losing weight'', ''Are you really in a calorie deficit?'', ''Are you counting your calories right?''. So I searched up what foods contain a lot more calories than you might guess and my jaw dropped. All the foods I've been eating are putting on hundreds and hundreds of calories on my meals without me even realising it. \n\nSince I cut out sugar the sugar cravings have been very difficult so I always ate fruit but specifically lots and lots of dark chocolate and nuts. Then I see that a small handful of nuts can contain about 200 calories, and a 100g bar of dark chocolate 70% which I ate in like 2 days contained 600 calories. That's not all bananas which I've been eating nonstop contain over 100 calories per banana!! I've been eating them like crazy about 2-3 everyday to control my sugar cravings. That's more than 200-300 calories alone. It would probably be less calories if I just ate the candy bar instead. And speaking of bars I've been eating a lot of protein bars since I thought they were healthy and good for my weight loss journey.  And they contain up to 400 calories per bar????\n\nAs well as my healthy avocado toasts I made every single day for breakfast. A single medium avocado has 250-300 calories. I'm sorry what?! And not to mention me being so proud for switching out white bread to healthy breads with nuts and whole-grain. But their literally 150-200 calories for one slice. \n\nI've been drowning my foods in olive oil since it's ''healthy'' and ''nutritious'' and then I see that 1 tablespoon is 119 calories. I feel like I'm daydreaming, how is that even possible? I can't even remember how much olive oil I put on each meal I have made!!\n\nI could go on and on and make this post a whole essay with 10k words and there are a lot more foods I haven't mentioned that I kept stuffing my face with since it was ''healthy'' and ''light-food''. \n\nRight now I sound like I do not know that food has calories. But I am just so in denial and shocked of how much I've been eating without me realising. Everything I eat on a daily basis has so many calories. I don't even know what to eat anymore.\n\n\nEdit: okay I thought this was a safe space for me to tell you guys my experience to get help and advice. Seeing all these comments is making me very disappointed and uncomfortable. I’m 18 and can’t re-do my mistakes but only learn from it and learn more along the way. 🩷\n\nEdit 2: thank you so much for all of the comments. I have downloaded some apps you guys mentioned and went through a whole day. It’s night time right now where I live and will briefly explain my day with the new knowledge I gained.\nI ate 3 meals and a snack where I counted every single calorie and it all came up to 1,093 calories in total. \nI know you guys recommended me to eat 1,500-1,700. But I’m feeling pretty full right now even with the little amount of calories. I’m a short girl so that may also be the reason. 😊\n\nAgain thank you for the help ! ",

I thought running a mile was impossible. Losing the weight changed everything. It showed me that if you stick to the basics and stay consistent, you can do anything you set your mind to. I’ve now run 2 marathons because of that lesson alone.\n\nHere are 5 things I wish I knew from day one:\n\n1. **Don’t try to go from A to C:** Most people start following someone’s “final form” routine or diet. If you’re trying to go from A to B, you don’t need the strictest diet on earth. You need to master the basics first.\n2. **Any diet works if you can stick to it:** Low carb, keto, intermittent fasting… they can all work, but only if you can actually live with them long term. Pick something you can see yourself doing a year from now.\n3. **Progress isn’t always visible:** The scale will stall, your body will look the same some weeks, but inside your habits are improving. Those “invisible wins” matter more than you think.\n4. **Your environment matters:** If your kitchen is full of junk food, your willpower won’t save you forever. Set yourself up to win by making the easy choice the right choice.\n5. **Start smaller than you think:** Don’t try to run every day or cut all sugar at once. Start with one daily walk, one healthier meal, or tracking your food. Small wins snowball into massive change.\n\nIf you’re reading this and you’re stuck, please remember that you're so strong for already putting in the work, and progress takes time! Im always here for feedback, guidance or advice :)",

Some days, I only managed 5k steps.\n\nAnd when I sprained my ankle and couldn’t even do that? I still lost 8 lbs in one month, with zero exercise, simply by being in a calorie deficit.\n\n\nWHICH BRINGS ME TO ANOTHER POINT:\n\nFad diets are complete bullsh*t.\n\nThroughout most of my journey, I was in a 200–400 calorie deficit, nothing extreme.\nAnd guess what? I ate whatever the hell I wanted:\n\n- Chocolate? Almost every day.\n- Pasta, bread, pizza, sugar? Yup.\n- “Clean eating”? Not always. \n\n\nIt doesn’t matter what kind of food you eat — what matters is the calorie deficit. That’s the only rule that counts. \n\nYes, it is easier with healthy food because you can eat more healthy food for less calories, but that does not mean you HAVE to cut out junk all together. \n\nIf you eat less calories than your body burns, your body is forced to pull energy from its fat stores. That’s it. It’s biology, not magic.\n\nWhen I first started, I had insulin resistance and a slow metabolism, which meant I felt hungry all the time. For ages, I blamed those things for why I couldn’t lose weight.\n(I was one of those people commenting on posts, “It’s just harder for some of us.”)\n\nAnd yes, insulin resistance made it a hell of a lot harder, and it made me hungrier; but I was still eating too much.\n\nI didn’t want to admit it, but I wasn’t being honest about how much I was eating, and I wasn’t willing to just sit with the feeling of hunger sometimes.\n\nOnce I stopped avoiding that truth and took accountability, everything changed.\n\nIt took me around 2 years, I started at 230 lbs, and now I’m sitting at 110 lbs.\n\nThe hard truth?\n\nThere’s no hack.\n\nNo tricks.\n\nNo secret.\n\nNo Magic.\n\nIt’s just consistency and determination.\n\nThat’s it.\n\nIt’s a long, boring, mentally exhausting journey — but it is so god damn worth it.\n\nDon’t give up.\n\nIf I can do it, so can you. 💪\n\n\nEDIT: Some people grow up reading books or study English literature at university; Just because I know how to use punctuation doesn't mean this post was written by ChatGPT. 🤦‍♀️\n\nEDIT 2: You can call me rude all you like. I've had enough of people trying to convince others that weight training / gyms are the \"only way\" — Some people have disabilities or cant afford a gym or dont have the time to go to a gym because they have family members to look after. So, if you're one of those people trying to bully others into a gym, or say stuff like \"you're going to regret not weight training,\" then yes, F*ck You. 🤷‍♀️ ",

For ages, I blamed those things for why I couldn’t lose weight.\n(I was one of those people commenting on posts, “It’s just harder for some of us.”)</p>\n\n<p>And yes, insulin resistance made it a hell of a lot harder, and it made me hungrier; but I was still eating too much.</p>\n\n<p>I didn’t want to admit it, but I wasn’t being honest about how much I was eating, and I wasn’t willing to just sit with the feeling of hunger sometimes.</p>\n\n<p>Once I stopped avoiding that truth and took accountability, everything changed.</p>\n\n<p>It took me around 2 years, I started at 230 lbs, and now I’m sitting at 110 lbs.</p>\n\n<p>The hard truth?</p>\n\n<p>There’s no hack.</p>\n\n<p>No tricks.</p>\n\n<p>No secret.</p>\n\n<p>No Magic.</p>\n\n<p>It’s just consistency and determination.</p>\n\n<p>That’s it.</p>\n\n<p>It’s a long, boring, mentally exhausting journey — but it is so god damn worth it.</p>\n\n<p>Don’t give up.</p>\n\n<p>If I can do it, so can you. 💪</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Some people grow up reading books or study English literature at university; Just because I know how to use punctuation doesn&#39;t mean this post was written by ChatGPT. 🤦‍♀️</p>\n\n<p>EDIT 2: You can call me rude all you like. I&#39;ve had enough of people trying to convince others that weight training / gyms are the &quot;only way&quot; — Some people have disabilities or cant afford a gym or dont have the time to go to a gym because they have family members to look after. So, if you&#39;re one of those people trying to bully others into a gym, or say stuff like &quot;you&#39;re going to regret not weight training,&quot; then yes, F*ck You. 🤷‍♀️ </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

    "title": "How I finally started losing weight after YEARS of failing (real talk).",
    "body": "Honestly, i feel like I wasted years chasing shortcuts. I tried keto, fasting, detox teas, gym memberships, apps… everything. I'd lose 5-10 lbs, then gain back 15. It wasn’t even about food sometimes. It was emotional. I’d eat when I was bored, sad, stressed, or just feeling empty. And every time I failed, I’d tell myself I had no discipline. i felt broken.\nThen last year something just snapped. I hit 248 lbs. I remember sitting in my car one night after eating an entire pizza alone, and I just cried. Not like a few tears, I mean full-on breakdown. That was the moment. Not because I felt fat. But because I felt like I had no control over my own life anymore.\nI decided to stop chasing big changes. I didn’t start with a gym. I didn’t start a strict diet. I just promised myself one thing: I would walk for 20 minutes every day. Rain or shine. That’s it.\nWeek 1 was rough. My legs hurt, I was breathing heavy, but I did it. Then week 2, I added drinking more water. No soda, just water and coffee. Then week 3, I cut out nighttime snacking. That was hard as hell. But by then I had built a little momentum. I didn’t want to break my streak,\nI didn’t tell anyone. I didn’t post anything online. It was just me vs me. I focused on building habits, not chasing a number. By month 2, I added simple home workouts. Nothing crazy. Just bodyweight stuff I found on YouTube. I started meal prepping because I knew if I came home tired and hungry, I'd eat whatever was around.\nFast forward 6 months, I was down 42 lbs. No fancy plan. No magic pill. Just small consistent steps and a lot of internal work. Therapy also helped me understand why I was turning to food. That changed everything.\nI still struggle sometimes. I still crave junk. But now I don’t feel like a prisoner in my own body. I feel like I’m finally driving again, not just sitting in the backseat of my own life.\nIf you're reading this and feel like you’ve failed too many times, please don’t give up. Start stupid small. One walk. One meal. One better choice. You don’t need to be perfect. You just need to not quit this time.",

    "title": "Venting: I got called out in front of 100 people",
    "body": "Hey, this is kind of going to be medium long.\n\nI(22F) went to a wedding yesterday. I was a bridesmaid. Culturally, we have a dowry ceremony first which was yesterday. In that ceremony, there’s a segment where the groom has to pick the bride out of a line up of women covered head to toe. Ideally, the line up has to be women of similar build and height to throw him off. There are fines starting off at $200 per wrong pick so understandably, the pressure is high. \n\nThe groom is my cousin and he almost got it wrong in the first round. So to ‘help’ him out, they put me in the next line up. Now here’s the title. As I came out in the line up, the crowd first laughed the MC told my cousin “They think you’re an idiot!😂You can’t even carry that one”. That’s a paraphrased translation as the literal one had a double entendre and local slang but you get the gist. \n\nNow, ofc I just blocked it out and laughed it off under the coverings but I’ve never been so grateful to have had my face covered. To add fire to the flame, my cousin come up to me (I’m sure he knew I was under there) and said “Darling you’ve become so big” like he was talking to his bride as a joke. I brushed that off too. Remember that this is in front of 100 people. \n\nAll that’s finished and I’m sitting in the car when my sister (11F) comes in with a friend. The friend is surprised to hear I’m her sister because she thought I was her mum and that I looked like I was in my 30s. That one kinda stung but I took it on the chin and kept it moving. \n\nFast forward to on the way home. The wedding was about a 3/4 hr drive away so we stopped for food and bathroom breaks. I order a serving of fries and a Diet Coke as dinner because I didn’t have any of my meal preps with me for dinner because I didn’t think we’d leave that late. Everyone knows I’m on my second weight loss journey. The first one was for my breast reduction and I managed to drop 27kg in 1.5(2020-2022)years through 300cal deficit and with gym time. This second one is I because I got too comfortable and gained it all back but I’ve managed to lose 7kg since start of July.\n\nAs we are sat eating dinner, my brother makes a jab at my weight because he wanted my fries after I said no. My mum comes in and he’s getting a scolding because he says these kinds of things to hurt me intentionally. She brings up the situation with the MC and it’s like the gates of a dam burst. I just got up, gave him my fries and went to the bathroom for a good 5 min cry. I came out and my brother tried to apologise and I said no because out relationship is already strained and this was just the last I could take.\n\nIm the family yapper but I was quiet for the rest of the car ride so they knew I was upset. Threw all the motivational stuff they could but I was quiet bc truly I was holding in what seemed to be 22yrs worth of tears. Tbh, I’m crying as I type this😂. I think it hurt so much because I thought nobody would remember what that MC said and now that I know for sure they do, I feel horrible and embarrassed. On top of the fact that I have never been attacked so much in a day. I just feel so beat because I think I told myself that no one really thinks that about me but now I know they do but they just don’t say it. My brother also continued to invalidate my feelings about it.\n\nThanks for getting this far, if you have any tips on how to stop crying I’d appreciate it lol. I’m not much of a crier so I don’t know how to deal with it.\n\n\nUpdate:\nI’d like to say thank you for all the wonderful and supportive comments and DMs. They’ve validated that I’m not crazy for feeling terrible <3 \nTo clear up some questions and misconceptions, No I am not India based and my brother is 27. \n\nSo I wrote this post in the morning after church in the car alone and my dad had not seen me so when he did, we were all in the car so he asked why I was crying and my sister told him it was because of my brother to which he (bro) said it’s not his fault, it’s the MC and I’m being sensitive because he never makes a fuss about it when people say the same to him. Please note that I NEVER ever say anything about people’s bodies. Anytime it’s brought up, I’m dead silent but he always ropes me into is saying “but she’s fat too”. He’s said pointed out my weight in every convo in the last week he’s been living with us.\n\nHe got a scolding for that as well from my dad saying he should stop talking about my weight with so much malice and he said that every time they(my parents) talk to him about his,he will talk about mine. The reason my parents warn us is because diabetes and arthritis is very prominent in our family and we are predisposed so being overweight would not be ideal for us.\n\nI have since decided to go no contact with him as it’s not just the weight jokes but so much more stuff. I’m basically an emotional punching bag for him. As for my cousin and the MC, my mum wrote them a very polite but firm message telling them that what transpired was wrong and they should be more considerate of others feelings. I also have dropped out of the wedding that’s slotted for December. This whole situation took me back to when I was a kid and I was the go to for flower girl spots until I got fat so I wasn’t even an option anymore. The resurfacing of that trauma has prompted me to drop out. This was my dad’s side of the family and I we are not close on that side.\n\nI will also be getting a therapist because boy oh boy do I have some crazy stories haha. One day I’ll feel safe enough to tell you all how I was told to hang on a meat hook so they could weigh me in front of an entire dining hall because they’d never seen someone so ‘big’ (they were a rural school so I just gave them grace and I was 10 so I couldn’t really fight and adult). \n\nTo all of us that have so many more similar stories, I’m very very sorry. It’s awful and we should be treated better🫂.",

      "selftext": "Hey, this is kind of going to be medium long.\n\nI(22F) went to a wedding yesterday. I was a bridesmaid. Culturally, we have a dowry ceremony first which was yesterday. In that ceremony, there’s a segment where the groom has to pick the bride out of a line up of women covered head to toe. Ideally, the line up has to be women of similar build and height to throw him off. There are fines starting off at $200 per wrong pick so understandably, the pressure is high. \n\nThe groom is my cousin and he almost got it wrong in the first round. So to ‘help’ him out, they put me in the next line up. Now here’s the title. As I came out in the line up, the crowd first laughed the MC told my cousin “They think you’re an idiot!😂You can’t even carry that one”. That’s a paraphrased translation as the literal one had a double entendre and local slang but you get the gist. \n\nNow, ofc I just blocked it out and laughed it off under the coverings but I’ve never been so grateful to have had my face covered. To add fire to the flame, my cousin come up to me (I’m sure he knew I was under there) and said “Darling you’ve become so big” like he was talking to his bride as a joke. I brushed that off too. Remember that this is in front of 100 people. \n\nAll that’s finished and I’m sitting in the car when my sister (11F) comes in with a friend. The friend is surprised to hear I’m her sister because she thought I was her mum and that I looked like I was in my 30s. That one kinda stung but I took it on the chin and kept it moving. \n\nFast forward to on the way home. The wedding was about a 3/4 hr drive away so we stopped for food and bathroom breaks. I order a serving of fries and a Diet Coke as dinner because I didn’t have any of my meal preps with me for dinner because I didn’t think we’d leave that late. Everyone knows I’m on my second weight loss journey. The first one was for my breast reduction and I managed to drop 27kg in 1.5(2020-2022)years through 300cal deficit and with gym time. This second one is I because I got too comfortable and gained it all back but I’ve managed to lose 7kg since start of July.\n\nAs we are sat eating dinner, my brother makes a jab at my weight because he wanted my fries after I said no. My mum comes in and he’s getting a scolding because he says these kinds of things to hurt me intentionally. She brings up the situation with the MC and it’s like the gates of a dam burst. I just got up, gave him my fries and went to the bathroom for a good 5 min cry. I came out and my brother tried to apologise and I said no because out relationship is already strained and this was just the last I could take.\n\nIm the family yapper but I was quiet for the rest of the car ride so they knew I was upset. Threw all the motivational stuff they could but I was quiet bc truly I was holding in what seemed to be 22yrs worth of tears. Tbh, I’m crying as I type this😂. I think it hurt so much because I thought nobody would remember what that MC said and now that I know for sure they do, I feel horrible and embarrassed. On top of the fact that I have never been attacked so much in a day. I just feel so beat because I think I told myself that no one really thinks that about me but now I know they do but they just don’t say it. My brother also continued to invalidate my feelings about it.\n\nThanks for getting this far, if you have any tips on how to stop crying I’d appreciate it lol. I’m not much of a crier so I don’t know how to deal with it.\n\n\nUpdate:\nI’d like to say thank you for all the wonderful and supportive comments and DMs. They’ve validated that I’m not crazy for feeling terrible <3 \nTo clear up some questions and misconceptions, No I am not India based and my brother is 27. \n\nSo I wrote this post in the morning after church in the car alone and my dad had not seen me so when he did, we were all in the car so he asked why I was crying and my sister told him it was because of my brother to which he (bro) said it’s not his fault, it’s the MC and I’m being sensitive because he never makes a fuss about it when people say the same to him. Please note that I NEVER ever say anything about people’s bodies. Anytime it’s brought up, I’m dead silent but he always ropes me into is saying “but she’s fat too”. He’s said pointed out my weight in every convo in the last week he’s been living with us.\n\nHe got a scolding for that as well from my dad saying he should stop talking about my weight with so much malice and he said that every time they(my parents) talk to him about his,he will talk about mine. The reason my parents warn us is because diabetes and arthritis is very prominent in our family and we are predisposed so being overweight would not be ideal for us.\n\nI have since decided to go no contact with him as it’s not just the weight jokes but so much more stuff. I’m basically an emotional punching bag for him. As for my cousin and the MC, my mum wrote them a very polite but firm message telling them that what transpired was wrong and they should be more considerate of others feelings. I also have dropped out of the wedding that’s slotted for December. This whole situation took me back to when I was a kid and I was the go to for flower girl spots until I got fat so I wasn’t even an option anymore. The resurfacing of that trauma has prompted me to drop out. This was my dad’s side of the family and I we are not close on that side.\n\nI will also be getting a therapist because boy oh boy do I have some crazy stories haha. One day I’ll feel safe enough to tell you all how I was told to hang on a meat hook so they could weigh me in front of an entire dining hall because they’d never seen someone so ‘big’ (they were a rural school so I just gave them grace and I was 10 so I couldn’t really fight and adult). \n\nTo all of us that have so many more similar stories, I’m very very sorry. It’s awful and we should be treated better🫂.",

It looked like a club and when I glanced at the calorie entry on fitness pal it said 460 which is a lot but manageable and I love sandwiches so I’d buckle and eat it.\n\nBut I noticed these past few months that no matter how much I stayed below my calorie budget, my weight loss majorly stagnated and sometimes I’d gain a few pounds. I thought I wasn’t trying hard enough and it was stressing me out.\n\nSo I was randomly checking their menu last Tuesday and I found out after months of eating this sandwich several times per week that the tracker considered a single sandwich to be 2 servings. So this whole time I had been eating a 920 calorie sandwich several days per week (sometimes twice a day when my dad bought me extra to take to work for lunch the next day).\n\nLo and behold, almost a week after cutting it out I started slowly losing a few pounds again. Y’all if this wasn’t so funny I’d be in shambles rn 😂 ",

    "body": "42m lost 140 pounds over about 2 years. 315 down to 177 where I've been for a few months now fairly comfortably.\n\nA little over 3 years ago I was so self-conscious about my weight I really hated having my picture taken. The heaviest I ever saw the scale read out was 315. The (intended) result is that there aren't many pics of me around then but I do have a few. After I saw the photos I was particularly displeased about I made a few big decisions.\n\n1. I needed to find my way back to happiness. I wasn't happy, I didn't treat myself like I was happy, and it showed.\n2. My drinking was out of control. It was bad and I was actively harming myself and my family by continuing to do it. 'Nuff said. I quit completely on April 23, 2023.\n3. I didn't care about immediate results bc I needed to change my life, and I knew that would take time. If I didn't, my Dr told me that the weight combined with my drinking was absolutely going to kill me. My liver numbers shocked my hematologist. Slow, sustainable changes stacked over time was the only way.\n\nThis is me at 315 (ish) [https://imgur.com/a/di2GgHo](https://imgur.com/a/di2GgHo)\n\nI was at the zoo with the fam and very hungover. I remember seeing the photos later and deciding then and there that at the very least the drinking had to go. That pic was in Aug 22, it took me a solid few months until April 23 to finally quit booze and have it stick.\n\nThe following summer in July 23 I went on a beach vaycay with my extended family. (It was mostly horrible!) While I was there though I realized that I was starting to find my happiness again, and that making healthier choices was working for me. I still wasn't totally happy with my body, but I was confident in myself enough to take this photo during that week while in the back of my head thinking: \"That's going to be the BEFORE\" pic.\n\n\\[NSFW\\] So here I am at the beach house at probably 270ish: [https://imgur.com/a/W4BTKOu](https://imgur.com/a/W4BTKOu)\n\nIn Oct of '23 I felt like the weight from quitting booze had mostly gone, so now it was time to tackle my diet. I ate like shit, mostly. Lots of carbs and sugar. (mmmmmmmm sugar) I gradually shifted to lower calorie, high protein meals and kept regular with my calorie tracking for a full year. Even after I hit my goal weight I kept at it bc I wanted to make sure that I could keep it up and maintain as well. So far, I've been roughy 177 lbs since June 2024. I also started gardening which inadvertently involved lots of heavy lifting, and accidentally started to bulk up doing that.\n\nIn July when I realized that I had muscle definition I'd not noticed before I got intentional about it and started doing free weight lifting several times a week. I say it was weights, but it was bundles of firewood I got at the grocery store. Two of em. Used bundles of wood all summer while also having sweet bonfires with my littles.\n\nThat brings us to today where I went to the gym and used a cabled lifting machine for the second time ever.\n\n\\[NSFW\\] Photo from this morning 177 lbs: [https://imgur.com/a/J6nrK6O](https://imgur.com/a/J6nrK6O)\n\nI don't know what else to say. I'm kinda stunned that I've done it. I obviously have no plans in quitting my fitness lifestyle any time soon, it just feels like \"ok, you made the changes! you did it!\" and Imma take today to celebrate that fact. Thanks to all of you for your posting and stories to encourage me as I lurked and planned my eventual (today!) post. \n\nI hope this give someone else out there the courage to do the hard thing they think they can't. I promise you, you can. And you're going to feel amazing after you've done it.",

All my friends are very body positive which is lovely, but it’s to the point where talking about trying to lose weight is very triggering and taboo and competitive. They would constantly say “no no you don’t need to lose weight, you look great! I can’t even tell that you gained weight!” But it was such a lie because obviously I was quite overweight. But anyway I lost the 45 out of 50 pounds and want to actually lose about 20 more to be at 115. But I am just very proud of myself! Yahoo!!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

So I bougth a treadmill on amazon for like 80$ and put it under my standing desk. At the beginning it was a bit weird, and I would often trip wile working but after 2-3 days I got used to it. On a normal day I would then walk 10k steps before 10am while still fasted, on alot of days, I would go over 20k.

I almost ate to my satisfaction the whole time. \n\nIn 2 months:  \n\\- I lost over 25 pounds  \n\\- My endurance increased a lot, long walks and my first 10 mile hike ever was managable  \n\\- I dropped one pant size  \n\\- I feel way better, metally and also just have more energy  \n\\- I also started to naturally drink more water\n\nSome challenges:   \n\\- You trip alot in the beginning  \n\\- May get some blisters  \n\\- Need good shoes for sure...   \n\\- You feel dizzy and even a bit nauseous when you get off a long session\n\nI know for most people, if you don't have the luxury of working from home, this wont work.

    "body": "I ended up losing 50 pounds by making a few simple changes. Here’s what worked for me\n\n1. **Water before food:** Every morning, I drank a glass of water before eating. It helped slow me down and kept me from overloading on breakfast.\n2. **Walk more:** I parked at the far end of the lot or took the stairs at work. These small choices added extra steps without much effort.\n3. **Same breakfast every day:** I stuck with eggs and toast. It was boring, but it kept me full and stopped me from snacking before 10 AM.\n4. **Remove chips:** I stopped buying chips. If they’re not in the house, I can’t eat them at 2 AM—and I saved money too.\n5. **Track your food :** I used a free app to keep an eye on what I ate, but I didn’t stress if I missed a day.\n6. **Prioritize sleep:** I made sure to get 7 hours of sleep. Without enough rest, I’d end up having no energy to go fro a walk or any other stuffs that would make me lose weight \n7. **Swap soda for seltzer:** I switched to seltzer. It didn’t taste great at first, but now seltzer tastes better then soda for me .\n8. **Use small plates:** Eating off smaller plates made my brain think I was eating more, which helped control portions.\n9. **Be flexible”:** I allowed myself to eat pizza sometimes and skipped walks on a few days. but i stayed consistent those things didn't ruin my plan for tomorrow.\n10. **Give yourself a reward:** When you hit a goal, do something fun that would motivate you do keep going and hit another goal, or any simple reward that makes you happy.\n\nThe biggest takeaway? You don’t have to be perfect. I still have days where I eat a whole bag of chips, but these tiny changes have made a big difference.",

This year I decided to finally do something about it and -15 kgs later I feel like I’m doing something right. I feel better mentally and physically, but my friends don’t understand it.\n\nWeight is a personal matter, so I don’t like talking about my lifestyle change with other people unless they bring it up. Even then I don’t like to go in detail about what it is I exactly do in order to lose weight (=counting calories and exercise), because I know it can be triggering for some people.\n\nMy friends invited me on a dinner a few days ago, and I decided to go. They ordered pizzas and pastas, but I wanted a healthier option, so I decided to have a goat cheese-salad. This immeaditely sparked conversation. It’s important to note that I’m the only overweight person in my friend group. They have been slim always.\n\nOne of my friends asked me ”salad, really? Don’t you think you deserve something more delicious?”. I explained to her that it’s not that I wouldn’t deserve it, but I’d rather make healthier decisions today. She continued: ”everything is healthy if you eat it moderatey”. I said that I fully agreed with her, but I didn’t want to eat a very calorie-dense meal today.\n\nShe looked at me with a sad look and told me I shouldn’t be counting calories, I’m perfect just the way I am. I tried explaining that I know that, but I must count calories to achieve my goal to be healthy. I never talked about my weight but tried to put emphasis on the health-side of it. But deep down I know the weight is the real reason for not feeling good enough. However, I’d never share that with anyone.\n\nMy other friends joined the conversation and tried to get me to change my order, but I stood my ground firmly: ”I think the salad is also a delicious choice”, ”You’re free to decide what you want, just let me decide on my own as well”. Eventually they gave up and I got to eat my salad, which was delicous by the way. I also tried my friend’s pizza, just a small bite.\n\nAfter the dinner the athmosphere was a bit quiet. When we left the restaurant my friend wanted to talk to me in private, and she expressed her concern about my rapid weight loss. I have not told her about it, but I guess -15kgs in 3 months is noticable. I assured her that I appreciate the concern, but I’m fine - in fact, I feel better than ever. She still kept going about how I need to be careful and I should stop counting calories for my happiness. Then, something just clicked in my brain.\n\nI told her the following: She would not understand what it has been like for me all my life. I have been big for my entire life, and it has limited my life in every single aspect. I want to live a full life with no regrets, and this plan is just my way of doing it. From emotional eating to struggling to accept myself because of it, I’m done with the self-pity and need to take action. I feel happier now, so why can’t you be happy for me?\n\nShe didn’t say anything and I just left her standing there. I still don’t know if she’s mad at me, but I’m still processing this as well. I’m not mad at her, but I wish I’d have friends who can support my journey, not discourage it. I know my reaction was harsh, but I seriously felt like that was the only way I could get her to understand my side of this matter.",

I am beyond happy and feel like i've slowly have gotten my life back. Yes, its been tough, but what's been helping is just consistency. In fact, I've been doing this deficit-exercise routine for so long it feels like the norm, but Ive slowly seen the results and realize what i've been doing this for. I just feel so great, ALL my pants fit me again, I cant believe it!! I just want to scream it out to the world!!! I CAN FIT IN MY PANTS!!! I've seen so many little victories its amazing. two years ago I bought a shirt that I thought was super cool. Bought it, went home, was super tight on me. disappointed and too lazy to return it, I just stuffed it in the back of my closet. last week I thought to myself, \"it probably wont fit but wouldn't hurt to try\", and it fit me PERFECTLY. Literally almost cried of happiness. That's when I realized that ive worked hard, and I can actually say Im proud of myself.\n\nJune 2024 I was 194 lbs. As of today (2/20/25), I am 152 lbs. \n\nI can finally look in the mirror without my heart dropping. I can FINALLY take group pictures with my friends without crying when I look back at it. I can finally let go of the hair tie i've tied to the button of my pants because my pants would fit too tight. I can finally wear my t-shirts instead of constant sweaters. I finally can be ME. I can actually start loving myself now.\n\nI'm not at my goal yet, I still need about 12 pounds to go, but I can proudly continue this journey knowing that I am so comfortable with myself. I can't believe I did it. Just wanted to share my victory and post my closure on here. I don't want necessarily to say I am super proud of myself, but I want to YELL that I am the happiest and most comfortable I've been in a long time. \n\nedit: i can’t respond to everyone, but i want to sincerely thank each of you for your love.❤️",

    "body": "Hey everyone, \n\n  \nSo I wanted to just post something that I hope will help anyone feeling a little lost, or like their route to weight loss is getting a little tough.\n\nMarch 2023, I stepped on the scales for the first time in over a year. It flashed up. **345.5.** I was stumped. In shock perhaps. For reference, I was 26 at the time, and am **5'5 and a female**. I hit rock bottom, genuinely. Although I was crawling around there for a while. \n\nOutwardly, I was confident, referring to myself as 'fat', pretending to not care. Loud and funny, certain of herself.\n\nInwardly, I was dying. Walking more than 5 minutes caused severe back pain. I was always sweating, out of breath constantly. I couldn't breath at night due to the fat on my chest and around my neck. I hated leaving the house, going for a food shop, going for coffees, exploring a new town. Essentially, living life. Everything was beyond uncomfortable, it was painful. \n\nTo cope, I drank most weekend, partied to try and forget how much I hated the prison I was in. I had a job that had me on my feet all day, but the second I got through that door in the evening, I ate. Every day was centred around food. I followed the body positive movement (no hate, I believe no one should feel shame about their bodies), but it actually enabled me. I told myself 'nothing is wrong with me, it is okay to be fat'. And yes, morally there is nothing wrong with me. I am not a morally superior woman now than I was at 345.5 pounds. But that isn't the point. I wasn't living anymore. Online, I saw other fat women post themselves and they looked so confident. I thought that I wasn't trying 'hard enough' to love myself like they could. \n\n  \nSo one day, I started counting calories, and I haven't stopped. I took it day by day, and thought, today, I am a little closer to a happier and healthier me. I started going for small walks, and these became longer and a little faster. I started talking to some trusted people about my feelings. I planned my next day. I then started thinking about how I could get more protein in, then more water. \n\nI celebrated the wins, and didn't beat myself up over any blips or 'stalls'. I forgot the timeline, and broke my weight loss into little chunks. I thought 'wow, can't wait to get into the next 10's of pounds (eg. 280 - 279), or the next stone bracket.\n\n  \nI never stopped getting my hair done, or my nails done. I focused on wearing what I felt comfortable in for that day. I laughed, I listened to good music, drank good coffee, and started going on adventures again.\n\n  \nI look back on myself from two years ago, and my initial reaction is 'god, how did I get there, I looked awful' I have had some people say similar things. But like with them, I stop myself and go, 'it was that version of me that took the first step, not this version of me. The only thing wrong with me was that I was lost'. \n\n  \nI can't believe how good life is now. I have found pockets of happiness or content in the every day life, mostly! Because that is where the change is - in your day. Get today right, and you'll get to where you want to be. But please know, each day is one step closer. I am so delighted that I have taken that first step. \n\n  \nThere were moments that I thought 'this is too hard, I want to live a little'. But living, to me, was learning some discipline and reaching for that delayed gratification instead of the instant kind. I am strong, resilient and capable of great things. \n\n  \nPlease keep going, focus on the day, get it right and you can't go wrong. \n\n  \nMy ultimate goal is 150, and I know I will get there. But I am focusing on today, and the next week so I can plan for anything that may be a challenge. I am excited. And always reminding myself of how my life has improved beyond my body. \n\n  \nSome tips that have helped me:\n\n1. Plan out tomorrow. I know what I will have for each meal, along with when I will do my walk. I lay out my clothes for work, along with my walking clothes. I have meal prepped and everything is ready to go.\n\n2. Focus on the day. I keep saying it, but seriously. How can you make your day a successful one? What does that look like to you. It is easy for my mind to run and say 'oh my god, I have X pounds to lose still'. Okay yes that is true. But I am going to focus on today, as this will get me a little closer. I can focus on the inputs. \n\n3. Calorie tracking. Before losing weight, there were days I was CONVINCED I wasn't eating 'that' much. The modern body pos/fat movement convinced me that I was meant to be this way. I wasn't. I was eating so much junk food, that it didn't appear like a lot at times, and I was always 'hungry' for actual nutrition. \n\n4. Not every day will be perfect, that is okay. There have been days and periods of time (hello Christmas) where I wasn't eating in a caloric deficit, or going for my daily walk. That's okay, I just back to it. It is helpful to give yourself a time period of not tracking. Over Christmas, I chose the days overall where I wouldn't track. And I knew which days I was getting back to my normal routine. This helps a lot. Stick to it. I know that I am going away for a weekend next month. Friday and Saturday will not be tracked. That's okay. I am going for my food shop Sunday, I know what I like to eat on a weekly basis. Having a deadline for yourself is key!\n\n5. It's all about those habits. Doing something most days, such as your caloric deficit or your walk, will get you to where you want to be. It's simple, not easy. You don't need to do anything crazy, it's just a bit boring at times. Find comfort in that.\n\n6. Dress for the you TODAY. Don't stop taking care of yourself. Showing myself that I am a human that should always be treated with kindness and respect has really built up my self confidence. I used to have zero. I remind myself to walk with confidence. Some days are better than others. But this has really helped me to understand that there is no 'good' and 'bad' versions of myself! \n\n7. Take that focus away from your physical looks. I used to think 'I have to go for this walk to burn calories', and now I think 'I get to go on my walk, I feel good mentally and helps with my stress levels, those happy chemicals really help me!'\n\n8. Following/reading weight loss material that feels GOOD for you. I looked at what I was reading and who I was following. I don't want to have a super ripped or toned body. I wanted to find people, women especially that lost a lot of weight, and are realistic for me. This forum helps me to focus on the positive, and it's great seeing those who have walked before me. \n\n  \nThanks for reading, any tips you would give? And again, not every day is perfect. I am always learning. But taking a break for a moment and looking back, I am so proud of myself. I am proud of all of you! ",

And always reminding myself of how my life has improved beyond my body. </p>\n\n<p>Some tips that have helped me:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Plan out tomorrow. I know what I will have for each meal, along with when I will do my walk. I lay out my clothes for work, along with my walking clothes. I have meal prepped and everything is ready to go.</p></li>\n<li><p>Focus on the day. I keep saying it, but seriously. How can you make your day a successful one? What does that look like to you. It is easy for my mind to run and say &#39;oh my god, I have X pounds to lose still&#39;. Okay yes that is true. But I am going to focus on today, as this will get me a little closer. I can focus on the inputs. </p></li>\n<li><p>Calorie tracking. Before losing weight, there were days I was CONVINCED I wasn&#39;t eating &#39;that&#39; much. The modern body pos/fat movement convinced me that I was meant to be this way. I wasn&#39;t. I was eating so much junk food, that it didn&#39;t appear like a lot at times, and I was always &#39;hungry&#39; for actual nutrition. </p></li>\n<li><p>Not every day will be perfect, that is okay. There have been days and periods of time (hello Christmas) where I wasn&#39;t eating in a caloric deficit, or going for my daily walk. That&#39;s okay, I just back to it. It is helpful to give yourself a time period of not tracking. Over Christmas, I chose the days overall where I wouldn&#39;t track. And I knew which days I was getting back to my normal routine. This helps a lot. Stick to it. I know that I am going away for a weekend next month. Friday and Saturday will not be tracked. That&#39;s okay. I am going for my food shop Sunday, I know what I like to eat on a weekly basis. Having a deadline for yourself is key!</p></li>\n<li><p>It&#39;s all about those habits. Doing something most days, such as your caloric deficit or your walk, will get you to where you want to be. It&#39;s simple, not easy. You don&#39;t need to do anything crazy, it&#39;s just a bit boring at times. Find comfort in that.</p></li>\n<li><p>Dress for the you TODAY. Don&#39;t stop taking care of yourself. Showing myself that I am a human that should always be treated with kindness and respect has really built up my self confidence. I used to have zero. I remind myself to walk with confidence. Some days are better than others. But this has really helped me to understand that there is no &#39;good&#39; and &#39;bad&#39; versions of myself! </p></li>\n<li><p>Take that focus away from your physical looks. I used to think &#39;I have to go for this walk to burn calories&#39;, and now I think &#39;I get to go on my walk, I feel good mentally and helps with my stress levels, those happy chemicals really help me!&#39;</p></li>\n<li><p>Following/reading weight loss material that feels GOOD for you. I looked at what I was reading and who I was following. I don&#39;t want to have a super ripped or toned body. I wanted to find people, women especially that lost a lot of weight, and are realistic for me. This forum helps me to focus on the positive, and it&#39;s great seeing those who have walked before me. </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Thanks for reading, any tips you would give? And again, not every day is perfect. I am always learning. But taking a break for a moment and looking back, I am so proud of myself. I am proud of all of you! </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

    "title": "Medication changes have made me realize how small of a role “willpower” plays",
    "body": "I used to believe the traditional story about weight loss. If you’re overweight it’s because you choose to over-indulge. Simply choose to eat less, like skinny people do everyday, and you’ll lose the weight. \n\nAfter developing a severe illness and cycling through several medications that impact my weight in both directions, I’m realizing how small of a role willpower makes in weight and eating. \n\nFor several months I was on a med that eliminated my appetite completely. Eating was a chore because my baseline state was feeling full and satiated (even with no food in my stomach), I felt better skipping meals. When I did eat, it only took 1-2 bites to feel nauseatingly full. Hospital staff had to encourage me to eat at every single meal, and I had to carefully plan out my food intake to attempt to get some nutrients. \n\nOn the flip side… I’m now on multiple medications that drastically increase my appetite. I’m hungry literally 24/7 no matter how recently I’ve eaten. Pre-meal I feel so ravenous I’m almost crazy, like “omg are there scraps in the trash can I can eat” level of crazy. The amount of food that used to made me feel full now doesn’t even make me feel neutral. I have to eat bucketfuls to even begin to feel like I’m not starving to death. And even after a full binge eating episode, I NEVER feel as full as I did when I was on appetite suppressing medication. The weak “kind of full but could still eat more” feeling I get only lasts 1-2 hours anyways before I’m ravenous again. \n\nI think there are a lot of “I feel like my stomach is going to explode if I nibble on one too many spears of broccoli” people who like to lecture about willpower to “I feel like I’m going to starve to death if I don’t eat an entire pizza” people. \n\nNow that I’ve been both types of people I don’t hold any moral superiority to thin people, or any negative judgments of overweight people. \n\nI also fully understand why weight loss medication is so popular - it’s only once your body can calm down from the “starving rabid animal” state that you can actually be on an equal playing ground to make good choices. And yeah - once you do feel neutral between meals, and food actually fills you up - then yes you do have choices to make between junk food and veggies. But until then you’re fighting a losing battle against your body’s powerful survival instincts. \n\nI’m sure there are outliers - people with very little appetite who gained weight eating nothing but junk, and people who are constantly ravenous but lost weight because they are exceptionally good at ignoring their hunger cues. \n\nFor me I’m trying to address the underlying feelings of hunger FIRST by tweaking medication, addressing blood sugar issues, etc., instead of trying to willpower my way through a broken appetite. \n\nI’m also just trying to give myself some grace.

    "body": "I commented this on another post and people seemed to find it helpful, so I thought I’d make a post explaining it to hopefully help more people!\n\nWhen I was in therapy for my EDs, my therapist had me set up a hunger cues scale to help me avoid binges. It is from 0-10. (My numbers were off in my comment for anyone who saw it. I was going off memory.) She suggested I not dip below a 3. \n\nHere is my scale:\n\n——-\n \n0 - famished. Feeling very faint. Super hangry. \n\n1 - what I call “wellbutrin” hungry, because it kills my hunger cues until I’m absolutely starved. This is where I’m feeling faint, getting a headache, feeling shaky and nauseous. \n\n2 - post-swimming hunger. Remember when you were a kid and you felt like you could eat a horse when you got out of the pool, but it wasn’t, like, unpleasant? That’s my point of no return. This is my final signal to eat something before I will binge, but I will probably overeat a little. Might describe as “starving.” \n\n3 - meal hungry. Like you are ready for dinner, but definitely not “starving.”\n\n4 - snacky, “I could eat.” Not a bad idea to eat something small with protein if a meal is a ways away.\n\n5 - neutral. No hunger or fullness cues whatsoever. \n\n6 - not quite satisfied from your meal. A light snack would put you right in the sweet spot.\n\n7 - satisfied. Not too full, ate just the right amount.\n\n8 - slightly over full. “I shouldn’t have had that last slice of pizza.” A little uncomfortable.\n\n9 - Definitely over full. Very uncomfortable. This is what I consider a binge. Felt out of control eating. \n\n10 - Painfully full. Completely lost control. Ignored all fullness cues for whatever reason. Feel nauseous and like you can’t even slouch. \n\n——-\n\nMy ideal range is to not dip below a 3 and not exceed a 7. To AVOID exceeding a 7, I cannot dip below a 3. I’ve had 28 years of evidence that I fully lose control when I get too hungry. \n\nAnyway, try writing your own 0-10 scale and see if it helps you in your fight against binge eating. This has been INSANELY helpful for me and if I actually pay attention and try to avoid leaving my range, I genuinely do not binge.",

    "body": "Some quick stats: F24, 5’1.5” (~157cm), SW: 255lbs (~115.7kg), CW: 225lbs (~102kg), BMI ~47.4 -> ~41.8\n\nA lil’ context: I started my journey mid November with a calorie deficit, strength training ~3 times a week, and at least 5,000 daily steps. \nI took a three week break from exercise through December-January, where I continued to eat at a (slightly smaller) deficit. These last two weeks I have taken another break and eaten at maintenance due to the flu and extreme medical stresses in my family, but I’ve gotten back on track today.\n\nSince I have started, I’ve lost 30lbs/13.6kg. (When the scale settled to 225, I was so excited to get on Reddit and change my flair lol) This is the first time in my entire life that I have lost weight through healthy and intentional means, and I could not be more happy about it. My resting heart rate has gone down, my energy levels have gone up, and although I still have some bad days, my overall confidence has vastly improved. \n\nAnd my progress pictures! Like, dang. Based on how obese I am, I would not expect 30lbs to make that much of a visual difference, so when I look at these pictures I can’t help but be somewhat suspicious of myself lmao. I think my strength training is probably playing a big role in my visual improvements, especially with things like posture. \n\nI cannot stress enough how all of this was only possible because I found this community back in November. Before, I thought weight loss was a right exclusive to the iron-willed. But you guys have proven that with the right education and resources, anyone can make improvements, one step at a time. Thank you all for sharing your stories and knowledge.\n\nSix months ago I was terrified of being seen in a grocery store because I felt like a blemish to society. Now days I’m out pumping weights next to gym bros, and although I’m still fat idgaf because the only thing that matters is that I’m actively trying to better myself.

    "body": "I posted on here some months ago about how upset I was that I was eating at a 600-700 calorie deficit daily and not lost a single pound. Oh, it waffled, it would go down .3 then back up .4 and such, but for 4 weeks I struggled and got nowhere. The breaking point was me sobbing in the locker room at the gym. \n\nI came here for support, and honestly didn’t get any, which is why I’m posting this. I mentioned in my post that I was weighing my food and religiously logging everything that went into my mouth, and whether you measured my deficit by my Apple Watch calorie burn OR a TDEE calculator, I had a 500+ calorie burn daily. I also mentioned that a few weeks prior I’d been to my doctor for bloodwork, and was diagnosed with Hashimoto’s(hypothyroidism). I had therefore just started taking levo to begin regulating my levels, but obviously only been on it for about a week and a half. \n\nBut I got ripped a new one. Told I was lying about weighing my food, and if I would just be honest with myself and tRY hArDeR then I would see the results I so desperately wanted. For the few people that believed me about weighing my food, they insisted that I had incorrectly calculated my TDEE and just needed to cut another 500 calories out of my diet. Even though I was eating like 1100-1200 calories a day. Yall, that’s dangerous eating disorder levels of advice!\n\nI kept on keeping on.

    "title": "It's been a year since I decided to lose weight (120 pounds lost in a year!): Here's my story of how I did it",
    "body": "So it’s been around one year to the day that I decided I wanted to lose weight and I feel like a totally different person physically (and mentally somewhat)!  I’ve lost 125 pounds (and counting) since then (150 pounds total) and I wanted to share my story of how I got there and how I’m feeling now.\n\nHere's me in June 2023 (unfortunately I don't have a picture of October 2023):\n\n[https://imgur.com/JIQGjAE](https://imgur.com/JIQGjAE)\n\nThis is me on the anniversary of the day I decided to lose weight October 5th, 2024 at the top of Mount Monadnock:\n\n[https://imgur.com/FgYrcuv](https://imgur.com/FgYrcuv)\n\nIt all started in March of 2023. I went to the Heart Attack Grill in Vegas with my wife (at the time anyway) and I weighed in at 345 pounds which was almost enough for a free burger. My wife was like “maybe you should think about losing weight”.  The food was great and I had a good meal there. \n\n2 weeks later, my wife tells me she wants a divorce. She says she’s moving out on August.  I was at rock bottom. I realized I couldn’t do the things that made me happy (and it was hard to take care of myself) and I knew I needed to make a change. But how?  I tried to go to the gym a couple times but I just wasn’t feeling it at all. I knew I needed to do something drastic but I didn’t know what.   \n\nEdit:  In August I went to LA and went to Universal. Could only ride on a couple rides (and one of them I was almost crushed by). I also wanted to ride the Mario Kart ride but was too big. I joked to my friend “maybe if I lose weight we can go to the Florida one when that opens in 2025”. That looks like that’s happening now!  This was another major factor in me deciding to lose the weight. \n\nThe first thing I did once my ex left was I ordered Factor meals for myself so I didn’t have to cook dinners on weeknights (I’m still using them now and they’ve been massively helpful). Edit:  At first they didn’t fill me up at all and would always eat more after but over time I adapted and got used to it. \n\nIn September I decided to go off my antidepressants because I felt like they were the cause of why I gained so much weight through the years (I was on them since the 7th grade for my depression/anxiety). This was to see if I would have less of an appetite on them. I was miserable but I was out of options and I wanted it to work so badly but it didn’t seem to change anything except for making my mood worse.  After 2 weeks,  something finally clicked and I started to feel full with less food. A turkey sandwich would finally fill me up when it didn’t before. But I almost wanted to go back on them because I was feeling shaky in terms of my mental health. Until…\n\nOn October 5, 2023 I had my physical at my doctors. I weighed in at 318 pounds, which was 27 pounds lighter than in March (I weighed 341 pounds at an appointment in June). I didn’t make any lifestyle changes but I had lost weight. This was all I needed to convince me to stay off the meds and to continue to push forward.  I could lose the weight!  I was actually doing it! \n\nIt was all a gradual process but I started to eat less and feel full with less food.  I started by getting rid of most processed foods with seed oils and other bad ingredients and focus on veggies, fruits, and protein. I made the mistake of completely eliminating all sweets and treats and that almost made me insane. So I made sure that I had snacks around but to make sure I didn’t have the whole bag or I can portion it out.  It was all really hard at first but I eventually got used to it. I did have some slip-ups though but was always able to get back on track the next day. \n\nThen, I slowly added exercise. I did the Dance Central video game first and then I did workout videos. Then I went to the gym and did cardio and finally added weights.  I would go to the gym once a week with my goal of exercising 3 times a week. I noticed that after every time I exercised I felt really good to the point where if I was feeling stressed I would feel better.   It was really hard but I was determined to lose weight. I was down to 300 pounds by late-November and I knew I was onto something  \n\nEdit:  December was a really rough month for me. I couldn’t sleep due to changes with my sleep apnea and CPAP machine (I couldn’t sleep without my mask anymore when I could before). I was tired all the time. I wanted a way out. But somehow I kept going since I knew it was my body adapting to my weight loss. There was no turning back now. \n\nI kept it going and stopped exercising in January because I was moving and selling my house (which actually gave me a bunch of exercise) for mental health reasons. I wasn’t doing well but I was someone able to stick with things in terms of eating less.  My weight loss did slow (I was down to 280 at the middle of the month) because I was treating myself to McDonalds more. But I was still losing weight.  I resumed exercising in February and started to count my calories to get back on track.\n\nIn March, I had an ah-ha moment where I felt like I NEEDED to exercise to get rid of stress I was feeling.  This was the push I needed. I started to exercise more and I signed up for Apple Fitness+ and started doing those videos. I started to exercise most days after work. This helped me with the stress after work and was starting to become a habit. \n\nIn April  (256 pounds at the start of the month) I added protein powder to my diet. This made the pounds melt off and is a huge help.  By the end of the month I was 243.5 pounds. This beat the usual 10 pounds a month I was losing before.  I continued to eat well and exercise regularly. I was making this into a habit and it was starting to feel like something I could continue doing forever. \n\nIn May, I had the realization that my depression was gone. Like totally gone. My anxiety had increased like 200% but I can actually focus on conquering that now that my depression is gone (since the depression would spiral me into negative thoughts I couldn’t get out of-without it I can change my thinking a lot easier).  I still can’t believe it even today but it happened!\n\nIn June (around 230 pounds), I realized that instead of going on the treadmill to do cardio I can go outside and see the world.  I started hiking around where I live. I  then found an organization that did group hikes (AMC) so I could meet new people (and work on my social anxiety).  I discovered I really loved to hike and it’s become a new hobby of mine!  I thought it was very appropriate that I hiked Mt. Monadnock on the anniversary of the day I decided to lose the weight (since I barely could get up a flight of stairs a year ago)!\n\nAt the same time, I also realized I can now do the things I wanted to do. I could go to gaming conventions and not be tired after walking around. I can walk around the city and see the sights a lot easier. I can do new activities like whitewater raft. I have so much energy now!  I had one of the best summers ever and visited so many new places (Niagara Falls, Philadelphia, Portland Oregon, and Maine, just to name a few). \n\nIn August, I started to stop counting calories. I had gotten so used to my eating habits that I realized that I didn’t need to do that. That combined with the fact I liked working out (in the mornings, especially which is also wild to me) meant I  knew I could keep things going without affecting my progress too much.  I knew it would help mentally, too.  I also finally crossed under 200 pounds later in the month!  Holy guacamole!\n\nI started having some health issues: some related to eating (my hunger receptors stopped telling me if I was hungry or full or sugar high and my stomach was cramping) and some not ( for example, my sleep-which has been a struggle for me since November 2023 because of my CPAP and sleep apnea).  This has affected my progress but somehow I’ve been able to keep going. Emotional eating had reared its ugly head (that used to be a huge problem of mine) but I’ve been able to manage it. Instead of reaching for ice cream, I reach for fruit or make a protein smoothie instead.  And if I do reach for the ice cream, I make sure only to have a little or 1 bar. If I do slip up , I get back on the bandwagon the next day. Even though you can lose the weight, that doesn’t mean that all your health issues will magically disappear and some others will show their ugly head. Even with the new health issues, I’m really glad with where I’m at compared to a year ago. \n\nI’m now around 192 pounds. I feel more confident in myself. I’m meeting new people (and even made a new friend). I’m seeing the world and doing the things I want to do to be happy.  I still have a long ways to go in terms of my anxiety (and a little ways to go in terms of my ultimate weight goal) but I’m improving and that’s all that matters. I’ve made healthy eating and exercise a habit. And even though I’m facing new health challenges, I feel like I can manage them better. Losing weight has become almost a secondary goal for me at this point. It’s nice that I’m still making progress but I’d rather focus on being happy and healthy with myself first.  I just wish I could tell my past self to lose the weight sooner. \n\nI never thought in one million years that I’d be going to the gym early in the morning, enjoy hiking (let alone on a vacation), and be able to  enjoy eating healthy, let alone drop 125 pounds in a year.  Just know that if I can do it, you can do it!  It’s definitely not easy and it’s not going to happen overnight, but if you put your mind to it and stick with it, it can happen for you, too!   \n\nEdit:  Thanks for all the comments!  I appreciate each and every one of you for reading my story and for showing your gratitude! I did add a few pieces of my story I forgot if you’re interested. Also, if you had a question or insight, I’ll get around to responding to it at some point. ",

It’s nice that I’m still making progress but I’d rather focus on being happy and healthy with myself first.  I just wish I could tell my past self to lose the weight sooner. \n\nI never thought in one million years that I’d be going to the gym early in the morning, enjoy hiking (let alone on a vacation), and be able to  enjoy eating healthy, let alone drop 125 pounds in a year.  Just know that if I can do it, you can do it!  It’s definitely not easy and it’s not going to happen overnight, but if you put your mind to it and stick with it, it can happen for you, too!   \n\nEdit:  Thanks for all the comments!  I appreciate each and every one of you for reading my story and for showing your gratitude! I did add a few pieces of my story I forgot if you’re interested. Also, if you had a question or insight, I’ll get around to responding to it at some point. ",

      "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>So it’s been around one year to the day that I decided I wanted to lose weight and I feel like a totally different person physically (and mentally somewhat)!  I’ve lost 125 pounds (and counting) since then (150 pounds total) and I wanted to share my story of how I got there and how I’m feeling now.</p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s me in June 2023 (unfortunately I don&#39;t have a picture of October 2023):</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/JIQGjAE\">https://imgur.com/JIQGjAE</a></p>\n\n<p>This is me on the anniversary of the day I decided to lose weight October 5th, 2024 at the top of Mount Monadnock:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/FgYrcuv\">https://imgur.com/FgYrcuv</a></p>\n\n<p>It all started in March of 2023. I went to the Heart Attack Grill in Vegas with my wife (at the time anyway) and I weighed in at 345 pounds which was almost enough for a free burger. My wife was like “maybe you should think about losing weight”.  The food was great and I had a good meal there. </p>\n\n<p>2 weeks later, my wife tells me she wants a divorce. She says she’s moving out on August.  I was at rock bottom. I realized I couldn’t do the things that made me happy (and it was hard to take care of myself) and I knew I needed to make a change. But how?  I tried to go to the gym a couple times but I just wasn’t feeling it at all. I knew I needed to do something drastic but I didn’t know what.   </p>\n\n<p>Edit:  In August I went to LA and went to Universal. Could only ride on a couple rides (and one of them I was almost crushed by). I also wanted to ride the Mario Kart ride but was too big. I joked to my friend “maybe if I lose weight we can go to the Florida one when that opens in 2025”. That looks like that’s happening now!  This was another major factor in me deciding to lose the weight. </p>\n\n<p>The first thing I did once my ex left was I ordered Factor meals for myself so I didn’t have to cook dinners on weeknights (I’m still using them now and they’ve been massively helpful). Edit:  At first they didn’t fill me up at all and would always eat more after but over time I adapted and got used to it. </p>\n\n<p>In September I decided to go off my antidepressants because I felt like they were the cause of why I gained so much weight through the years (I was on them since the 7th grade for my depression/anxiety). This was to see if I would have less of an appetite on them. I was miserable but I was out of options and I wanted it to work so badly but it didn’t seem to change anything except for making my mood worse.  After 2 weeks,  something finally clicked and I started to feel full with less food. A turkey sandwich would finally fill me up when it didn’t before. But I almost wanted to go back on them because I was feeling shaky in terms of my mental health. Until…</p>\n\n<p>On October 5, 2023 I had my physical at my doctors. I weighed in at 318 pounds, which was 27 pounds lighter than in March (I weighed 341 pounds at an appointment in June). I didn’t make any lifestyle changes but I had lost weight. This was all I needed to convince me to stay off the meds and to continue to push forward.  I could lose the weight!  I was actually doing it! </p>\n\n<p>It was all a gradual process but I started to eat less and feel full with less food.  I started by getting rid of most processed foods with seed oils and other bad ingredients and focus on veggies, fruits, and protein. I made the mistake of completely eliminating all sweets and treats and that almost made me insane. So I made sure that I had snacks around but to make sure I didn’t have the whole bag or I can portion it out.  It was all really hard at first but I eventually got used to it. I did have some slip-ups though but was always able to get back on track the next day. </p>\n\n<p>Then, I slowly added exercise. I did the Dance Central video game first and then I did workout videos. Then I went to the gym and did cardio and finally added weights.  I would go to the gym once a week with my goal of exercising 3 times a week. I noticed that after every time I exercised I felt really good to the point where if I was feeling stressed I would feel better.   It was really hard but I was determined to lose weight. I was down to 300 pounds by late-November and I knew I was onto something  </p>\n\n<p>Edit:  December was a really rough month for me. I couldn’t sleep due to changes with my sleep apnea and CPAP machine (I couldn’t sleep without my mask anymore when I could before). I was tired all the time. I wanted a way out. But somehow I kept going since I knew it was my body adapting to my weight loss. There was no turning back now. </p>\n\n<p>I kept it going and stopped exercising in January because I was moving and selling my house (which actually gave me a bunch of exercise) for mental health reasons. I wasn’t doing well but I was someone able to stick with things in terms of eating less.  My weight loss did slow (I was down to 280 at the middle of the month) because I was treating myself to McDonalds more. But I was still losing weight.  I resumed exercising in February and started to count my calories to get back on track.</p>\n\n<p>In March, I had an ah-ha moment where I felt like I NEEDED to exercise to get rid of stress I was feeling.  This was the push I needed. I started to exercise more and I signed up for Apple Fitness+ and started doing those videos. I started to exercise most days after work. This helped me with the stress after work and was starting to become a habit. </p>\n\n<p>In April  (256 pounds at the start of the month) I added protein powder to my diet. This made the pounds melt off and is a huge help.  By the end of the month I was 243.5 pounds. This beat the usual 10 pounds a month I was losing before.  I continued to eat well and exercise regularly. I was making this into a habit and it was starting to feel like something I could continue doing forever. </p>\n\n<p>In May, I had the realization that my depression was gone. Like totally gone. My anxiety had increased like 200% but I can actually focus on conquering that now that my depression is gone (since the depression would spiral me into negative thoughts I couldn’t get out of-without it I can change my thinking a lot easier).  I still can’t believe it even today but it happened!</p>\n\n<p>In June (around 230 pounds), I realized that instead of going on the treadmill to do cardio I can go outside and see the world.  I started hiking around where I live. I  then found an organization that did group hikes (AMC) so I could meet new people (and work on my social anxiety).  I discovered I really loved to hike and it’s become a new hobby of mine!  I thought it was very appropriate that I hiked Mt. Monadnock on the anniversary of the day I decided to lose the weight (since I barely could get up a flight of stairs a year ago)!</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, I also realized I can now do the things I wanted to do. I could go to gaming conventions and not be tired after walking around. I can walk around the city and see the sights a lot easier. I can do new activities like whitewater raft. I have so much energy now!  I had one of the best summers ever and visited so many new places (Niagara Falls, Philadelphia, Portland Oregon, and Maine, just to name a few). </p>\n\n<p>In August, I started to stop counting calories. I had gotten so used to my eating habits that I realized that I didn’t need to do that. That combined with the fact I liked working out (in the mornings, especially which is also wild to me) meant I  knew I could keep things going without affecting my progress too much.  I knew it would help mentally, too.  I also finally crossed under 200 pounds later in the month!  Holy guacamole!</p>\n\n<p>I started having some health issues: some related to eating (my hunger receptors stopped telling me if I was hungry or full or sugar high and my stomach was cramping) and some not ( for example, my sleep-which has been a struggle for me since November 2023 because of my CPAP and sleep apnea).  This has affected my progress but somehow I’ve been able to keep going. Emotional eating had reared its ugly head (that used to be a huge problem of mine) but I’ve been able to manage it. Instead of reaching for ice cream, I reach for fruit or make a protein smoothie instead.  And if I do reach for the ice cream, I make sure only to have a little or 1 bar. If I do slip up , I get back on the bandwagon the next day. Even though you can lose the weight, that doesn’t mean that all your health issues will magically disappear and some others will show their ugly head. Even with the new health issues, I’m really glad with where I’m at compared to a year ago. </p>\n\n<p>I’m now around 192 pounds. I feel more confident in myself. I’m meeting new people (and even made a new friend). I’m seeing the world and doing the things I want to do to be happy.  I still have a long ways to go in terms of my anxiety (and a little ways to go in terms of my ultimate weight goal) but I’m improving and that’s all that matters. I’ve made healthy eating and exercise a habit. And even though I’m facing new health challenges, I feel like I can manage them better. Losing weight has become almost a secondary goal for me at this point. It’s nice that I’m still making progress but I’d rather focus on being happy and healthy with myself first.  I just wish I could tell my past self to lose the weight sooner. </p>\n\n<p>I never thought in one million years that I’d be going to the gym early in the morning, enjoy hiking (let alone on a vacation), and be able to  enjoy eating healthy, let alone drop 125 pounds in a year.  Just know that if I can do it, you can do it!  It’s definitely not easy and it’s not going to happen overnight, but if you put your mind to it and stick with it, it can happen for you, too!   </p>\n\n<p>Edit:  Thanks for all the comments!

It took about 6 months for me and I went from 240 to 190.\n\n1) I swapped out anything and everything I could for low calorie alternatives (diet soda, coffee creamer, butter spread, etc).\n\n2) I stopped making myself eat in the name of nutrition. So if I finished a meal before I ate my protein, for example, I wouldn’t force myself to eat it. Or if I didn’t feel like having breakfast, I would skip. This surprisingly makes a major difference.\n\n3) I stopped buying large containers of junk food and keeping them around the house. Instead I just buy one or two single serving items.\n\n4)I had to reduce fat bc of cholesterol, but this had the added effect of reducing calories(fat has the highest #of calories per gram). I don’t suggest fat free because it’s usually awful, but part skim dairy is pretty good most of the time.\n\n5) I started drinking a lot of coffee mostly for energy, but it really does help with reducing appetite. \n\n6) I bought a lot of easy ready made things so if I was tired I couldn’t use the excuse to eat junk. This includes grilled chicken strips, cut fruit, microwave rice and oatmeal.\n\nAnd that’s it! I’m going to start tracking calories soon because I’ve stopped losing weight, but if you want a simple starting plan try this. I promise that if someone like me who still sometimes eats frosting straight from the jar as a midnight snack can do it, so can you lmao. Good luck :)",

It took about 6 months for me and I went from 240 to 190.</p>\n\n<p>1) I swapped out anything and everything I could for low calorie alternatives (diet soda, coffee creamer, butter spread, etc).</p>\n\n<p>2) I stopped making myself eat in the name of nutrition. So if I finished a meal before I ate my protein, for example, I wouldn’t force myself to eat it. Or if I didn’t feel like having breakfast, I would skip. This surprisingly makes a major difference.</p>\n\n<p>3) I stopped buying large containers of junk food and keeping them around the house. Instead I just buy one or two single serving items.</p>\n\n<p>4)I had to reduce fat bc of cholesterol, but this had the added effect of reducing calories(fat has the highest #of calories per gram). I don’t suggest fat free because it’s usually awful, but part skim dairy is pretty good most of the time.</p>\n\n<p>5) I started drinking a lot of coffee mostly for energy, but it really does help with reducing appetite. </p>\n\n<p>6) I bought a lot of easy ready made things so if I was tired I couldn’t use the excuse to eat junk. This includes grilled chicken strips, cut fruit, microwave rice and oatmeal.</p>\n\n<p>And that’s it! I’m going to start tracking calories soon because I’ve stopped losing weight, but if you want a simple starting plan try this. I promise that if someone like me who still sometimes eats frosting straight from the jar as a midnight snack can do it, so can you lmao. Good luck :)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

    "body": "I'm 20F 295lb going to 186lb. \nA little vent here. \nLosing weight in America is damn near impossible here.\nI lived in asia for 5 years and it was so easy to lose weight and stay fit. Calories in, calories out, exercise at home, running 5 times a week and keep it moving. I would lose weight so much so, that I would keep dropping the pounds even if I didn't do anything. I left the states about 30-40 pounds down from my weight loss journey. I was a thrilled 260lb woman and even had before and after photos. \n\nComing back to America a couple of months ago, I kept my regime together and I still gained 10lbs. I'm thinking, \"okay, I can still keep going\", but then life happened. I dealt with personal issues, break ups and Schoolwork. I finally picked myself back up 4- 5 months later and checked the scale a couple days ago and I gained everything I lost back. Months of running, calorie counting, and sacrifices gone in a few months. \n\nHere, The portion sizes are huge, everything is sweet and sugary, and nothing around here is walkable. Even with my job where I'm on my feet for almost 8 hours a day doesn't help. It just seems impossible to get back on track  without totally isolating yourself and never eating outside of the house.\n\nSo now I'm back here at 295lbs after a bell curve of a weight loss journey. I still can't believe I lost 30 something pounds, Moved to the US and gained it all back. I cant understand how y'all can do this.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the helpful advice and the encouragement. \nI appreciate those who shared their weight loss experiences here.   Yes, weight loss is more difficult, tedious and unforgiving here, but its also, not non-existent. I read every single comment and most were very helpful and gave unique tips I didn't even know existed. I'll update on progress. \n",

And after weeks of trying you know what my average is?</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Fucking. Grams.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>turns out plants lied on their resume and contain next to no fiber despite being the only known source on this godforsaken planet. Even bran, the poster child for fiber, sits at maybe 15%. And 400kcal per 100g</p>\n\n<p>I would have to dedicate 2/3 of my calorie allowance to fiber to meet my goal. I would shit sawdust. How long could I survive before my plumber ordered a hit on me?</p>\n\n<p>On the topic of calories: WHY is fiber counted despite being non-digestible by definition. Are my gut bacteria dieting with me? Does my microbiom need to slim down? </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d love to say I&#39;m going strong but my last idea turned out to be some stupid supplement with enough artificial sweeteners in a serving to kill a medium sized dog. Unless of course I go mad at some point and go back to my preschool habit of eating cardboard.</p>\n\n<p>in conclusion: god damn it</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

    "body": "here's how\nSimple 30-minute post-dinner walks helped me maintain my 30lb weight loss and improved my sleep quality.\n\nHey everyone! I wanted to share something that's been a total game-changer for my weight maintenance journey.\n\nBackground: I managed to lose 30lbs (from 200 to 170) through a combination of intense cardio, strength training 3-4x per week, and healthy eating. But here's the thing - that level of exercise wasn't sustainable long-term, and I was worried about maintaining my weight loss.\n\nThe simple habit that made all the difference: Post-dinner walks.\n\nHere's my routine: About 30 minutes to an hour after eating dinner, I head out for a walk around my neighborhood. Nothing crazy - just 1.5 to 2km at a comfortable pace. If it's hot out, I might work up a light sweat, but it's super low-intensity.\n\nWhy this works so well:\n\nHelps with digestion (no more feeling uncomfortably full after dinner)\nBurns some extra calories without being exhausting\nPerfect timing - won't interfere with sleep like late evening workouts can\nEasy to maintain as a daily habit\nCurrent routine vs. before:\n\nBefore: 3-4 strength sessions per week + 3km daily runs\nNow: 1 strength session per week + 2-3 runs per week (3km each) + daily post-dinner walks\nI've been maintaining around 170lbs for months now with this much more manageable routine, and my sleep quality has actually improved!\n\nThe wake-up call: During a particularly rainy stretch, I got lazy and skipped my walks for 2-3 weeks. My weight shot up to 180lbs - it was honestly shocking how fast it came back. That's when I realized how crucial these walks were for my maintenance.\nSince I WFH, I invested in a walking pad (treadmill). Now even when it's pouring rain, I can still get my post-dinner walk in at home. No more excuses!\n\nBottom line: You don't need intense workouts to maintain weight loss. Sometimes the simplest habits make the biggest difference. These walks have become such a natural part of my evening routine, and the consistency is what really matters.\n\nAnyone else have success with gentle post-meal movement? Would love to hear your experiences!",

During my weightloss journey, the hard part wasnt even the calorie counting or exercising, it’s dealing with the environment and cultural standards around me in Asia, especially in (South) East Asia.\n\nWhere I live, I already fit into size M or sometimes even L, which feels crazy because in Western sizing I’d probably be an S. A lot of brands have “free size” clothing that basically assumes you’re under 55kg (120lbs). Anything above that and you’re automatically “large\", and its defeating to look for clothes when I was 65kg (143lbs). It felt uncomfortable and almost all the clothes I liked did not fit. \n\nOn top of that, Asian BMI charts are weird, and I'm not sure if BMI is 100% reliable to begin with. They call you overweight starting at 23. So while the West says 18.5–24.9 is healthy, back home anything above 60kg at my height is often seen as “too big.” Moms, aunties, even strangers won’t hesitate to tell you you’ve gained weight, and it’s just considered normal conversation. If I had a cent everytime an Asian aunty makes a backhanded comment about my weight, Jeff Bezos would be a nobody to me.\n\nThe beauty standard in Asia would honestly be considered ED territory or even anorexic in Western countries. I see so many girls my height aiming for 45-48kg (105lbs?) sometimes less, and it makes me question what “healthy” even looks like. Don't even mention the models and actresses on mass media. Bella Hadid is no match for them imo. \n\nHas anyone else here (especially from Asian backgrounds) had the same experience? How did you balance wanting to lose weight for yourself with not falling into toxic standards that make you feel like you’re never enough?\n\nThanks for reading.

During my weightloss journey, the hard part wasnt even the calorie counting or exercising, it’s dealing with the environment and cultural standards around me in Asia, especially in (South) East Asia.</p>\n\n<p>Where I live, I already fit into size M or sometimes even L, which feels crazy because in Western sizing I’d probably be an S. A lot of brands have “free size” clothing that basically assumes you’re under 55kg (120lbs). Anything above that and you’re automatically “large&quot;, and its defeating to look for clothes when I was 65kg (143lbs). It felt uncomfortable and almost all the clothes I liked did not fit. </p>\n\n<p>On top of that, Asian BMI charts are weird, and I&#39;m not sure if BMI is 100% reliable to begin with. They call you overweight starting at 23. So while the West says 18.5–24.9 is healthy, back home anything above 60kg at my height is often seen as “too big.” Moms, aunties, even strangers won’t hesitate to tell you you’ve gained weight, and it’s just considered normal conversation. If I had a cent everytime an Asian aunty makes a backhanded comment about my weight, Jeff Bezos would be a nobody to me.</p>\n\n<p>The beauty standard in Asia would honestly be considered ED territory or even anorexic in Western countries. I see so many girls my height aiming for 45-48kg (105lbs?) sometimes less, and it makes me question what “healthy” even looks like. Don&#39;t even mention the models and actresses on mass media. Bella Hadid is no match for them imo. </p>\n\n<p>Has anyone else here (especially from Asian backgrounds) had the same experience? How did you balance wanting to lose weight for yourself with not falling into toxic standards that make you feel like you’re never enough?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for reading. I just needed to get this off my chest.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

I think it's been making her insecure about her own weight. Before I could say anything about it though, she told me what she had for breakfast: toasted white bread with jam and butter, a bowl of cereal, and a cup of fruit juice. She followed that up with a \"that's healthy, right?\". \n\nOf course, _we_ know that it isn't. _We_ know that all are ultra-processed foods, high in carbs and sugars and therefore calories, that they won't keep her satiated, and that the actual portion sizes of these foods and drinks are minescule compared to what most people would guess. But, we only know because we're going out of our way to inform ourselves on nutrition and weight loss. Of course she would think it's healthy. Why wouldn't she? Everything, every TV show and advertisement and societal norm and storybook and so on, has depicted these foods as normal breakfasts. \n\nThis is what really made me sad. Junk like chips and cookies and whatever, their business is a whole nother evil, and what an absolute evil it is. But at least people _know_ they're unhealthy and that they _should_ cut down on them. The foods like those that my mother was eating, though? People go their whole lives unaware of what crap they're putting in their bodies, and it isn't even their fault. They've been lied to and kept ignorant their entire lives, they have no reason to even think to question it. All of this stacked with sugar addiction and appeals to convenience and mindless or stress eating and a billion other things... The modern world really is upsetting.\n\n\nEdit: I don't mean to sound judgy, sorry! I'm her child after all, I used to eat just like this. It's really not reflective of any fault of hers or anybody else who has the same habits. I'm upset at the poor health education our society gives us. My parents are obese and my father is pre-diabetic, I just want to help my loved ones be healthier.",

I recently went on vacation but couldn’t do any of the activities I wanted to do like zip lining or riding the water slides. This to me, is devastating that I’m missing out on some of the best times of my life and not able to enjoy them to the fullest because of my weight. </p>\n\n<p>The whole time I was on vacation I had a nagging thought that I needed to make real change when I got home. Something different this time. I’ve tried weight watchers, tracking calories in my fitness pal, and weighing out all my foods. The monotony of constantly scaling out my food or entering it into a tracker was not sustainable for me and I didn’t think there was any other way. </p>\n\n<p>I needed to do something reasonable and accessible. I’m addicted to fast food, how can I make this convenient? I decided to meal prep. 4 days at a time so i’m not getting bored of things. I went to costco, bought ground beef, chicken, breakfast burritos and vegetables. I made salad which chicken (I love salads so much) and lean ground beef with rice and veg. I didn’t weigh anything out, instead I did 3/4 cup portions of beef and rice, and gave myself as much chicken breast as I felt like (3 breast spread over 4 days). I ate everything i meal prepped everyday and went to the gym on top of that. </p>\n\n<p>Day two hits of my journey. My mom is sent to the hospital. All of a sudden fast food feels like the ONLY option. I saw something online that said “I go to the gym because that’s what the girl of my dreams would do”. I want to be the girl i’ve always dreamed of. I tell myself that if I can stay consistent through this difficult time I can stay consistent through anything. </p>\n\n<p>I start a routine. After work everyday, I quickly stop by the hospital to visit mom. Then I go to the gym for an hour. After that, I go back to the hospital and watch a movie or chat with mom until she falls asleep. After that, I go to my apartment, warm up my meal prep dinner take a shower and go to bed. (My mom will be ok btw, just got very sick on vacation and hasn’t been able to shake it) </p>\n\n<p>I’m starting to feel like this is going to be ok. I’m starting to feel like I can do this. I’m starting to feel like maybe I CAN be the version of myself i’m always dreaming of. </p>\n\n<p>i stepped on the scale and im almost 10lbs down from my heaviest weight just before I left for vacation a few weeks ago. It’s only been 8 days but I feel amazing and I actually have energy. I’m unfortunately sick now too after being in the hospital so frequently, but i’m finding joy in movement while i’m sick and I feel motivated by my own actions every single day. </p>\n\n<p>I’m a little bit proud of myself right now. I really feel like I can do this. </p>\n\n<p>SW: 338 \nCW: 327 </p>\n\n<p>I got this! I can do this!! </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

So I've been in a manageable calorie deficit while also keeping my protein intake high.\n\nTonight, I wasn't feeling well. My bf asked me what was wrong and I couldn't really explain. I took the time to reflect a little and I realized I was anxious. I made tea hoping it would help. I laid down a little.\n\nThen I grabbed a snack. I knew I wasn't hungry, but I was like \"Oh it'll feel nice\". That mini Kind bar turned into 4. Then I wanted something else. Considered ordering fast food. Decided against it.\n\nI told myself I was probably eating too much because I didn't have enough protein today. I ate some cottage cheese. Then I made toast. Then I scarfed down a gigantic bowl of fruit.\n\nAnd staring at my empty bowl I realize all this started because I was anxious. I didn't go outside today, and I didn't exercise. I had a stressful day at work, my bf's video game sounds are driving me crazy and my daughter has been yapping on the phone (on speakerphone) all evening. I'm overstimulated, overwhelmed and anxious.\n\nI did nothing for myself today. I woke up, fed the cats, made sure my daughter had a lunch for school, worked, ran errands for the household on my lunch break, cancelled my yoga class to go to the gym with my daughter - but then she decided she didn't want to go anymore and it was too late to rebook my class. I made dinner, started some laundry and now I'm here.\n\nI really eat to feel like I'm here. I eat to come back into my body when my mind is racing and I can't catch my breath. I literally never realized this before. I try to ground myself with food.\n\nHas anyone found good techniques to help with that? Preferably not exercise related as I already exercise a lot. I also do yoga and am familiar with breathing exercises, but they don't help. ",

On the rare occasion that I would try &quot;cheating&quot;, I got overwhelmed with how sweet everything was. I remember getting a small Slurpee (it was Free Slurpee Day at 7-11), and I could only get about halfway through it before I just threw the rest out because it was too sweet - in fact the only thing I liked about the drink was that it was really cold on a hot summer day. Before quitting sugar, I was eating it constantly (turns out the way my ADHD brain like to stim was through sweets.) And now I&#39;m shocked that I had that much tolerance for it.</p>\n\n<p>My brother used to be an avid smoker but quit 20 years ago (and has been off nicotine ever since). When I was describing the phenomenon of everything being &quot;too sweet&quot; he said this:</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Sugar is kinda like smoking - you might not like the first cigarette, but the later ones are the ones that get you hooked.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>While I have been slowly reintroducing sweets since my fast - I am now a lot more discriminate about what sugar I do eat.</p>\n\n<p>The grocery store cake my office bought for someone&#39;s birthday? I&#39;ll pass.</p>\n\n<p>The homemade cake my wife made? Yeah, I&#39;ll have a small slice.</p>\n\n<p>After a lifetime of eating sugar mindlessly, it&#39;s interesting to have control over it now.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

If you do OMAD, consult with a professional! There are dangers like gallstones! Be informed!!!\n\nIn my journey, it was very important for me to realize that when something says it’s a certain amount of calories, listen! I was eating so many more calories than I thought I was because I was just helping myself unrestricted to the worst food possible. I’ve started cooking at home more and only eating once a day. Cooking at home really helps with weaning yourself off the American diet. All those foods are engineered to addict you and keep you that way. I was able to see how much butter, salt, oil, etc I was putting into my food and it really helped maintain my weight. I’ve also been trying to do at least 5k steps a day (which is hard the days I don’t work or don’t have school). Best of luck!\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/6btBLLR \n\nEdit: Thanks for all the support!

I managed to lose 20 kilos in the past two years but still have fat around my stomach I couldn’t seem to move. I have also had difficultly getting the results I wanted in my glutes.\n\nMy desire to lose weight was motivated by my blood pressure being diagnosed as high after a lifetime of having blood pressure on the low side. I was around 79 kilos at the time (im 5’3). Then for the past 2 years I started getting other symptoms such as hair loss on head, facial hair, acne, joint pain, migraines during my cycle.  These symptoms all persisted despite my experiencing and losing weight. I assumed it was my PCOS flaring up. \n\nRecently I did some tests which showed my testosterone was low and my iron is getting high (I have hemochromatosis but it’s usually manageable through blood letting). That along with the irregular periods I have gotten the past couple of months and new symptoms like night sweats and difficultly sleeping have lead to my diagnosis of early onset menopause. \n\nIt’s been a relief to be honest, I thought I was going crazy losing chunks of hair in the shower like I did after my pregnancy! My body scans at gym were saying I was losing muscle mass when I was upping my protien and exercising still. I have managed to regain that muscule mass through hard work with my nutritionist and PT.\n\nIm only 41 and these symptoms started when I was 39. It took me several doctors to listen to me. For women in this age group please listen to your bodies. If your not getting the results you want, if your tired all the time or in pain, go see someone and dont stop until you get some answers.

I was around 79 kilos at the time (im 5’3). Then for the past 2 years I started getting other symptoms such as hair loss on head, facial hair, acne, joint pain, migraines during my cycle.  These symptoms all persisted despite my experiencing and losing weight. I assumed it was my PCOS flaring up. \n\nRecently I did some tests which showed my testosterone was low and my iron is getting high (I have hemochromatosis but it’s usually manageable through blood letting). That along with the irregular periods I have gotten the past couple of months and new symptoms like night sweats and difficultly sleeping have lead to my diagnosis of early onset menopause. \n\nIt’s been a relief to be honest, I thought I was going crazy losing chunks of hair in the shower like I did after my pregnancy! My body scans at gym were saying I was losing muscle mass when I was upping my protien and exercising still. I have managed to regain that muscule mass through hard work with my nutritionist and PT.\n\nIm only 41 and these symptoms started when I was 39. It took me several doctors to listen to me. For women in this age group please listen to your bodies. If your not getting the results you want, if your tired all the time or in pain, go see someone and dont stop until you get some answers. Don’t let anyone tell you it’s in your head or you just need to work a bit harder, cut more calories. Listen to the messages your body is sending and best of luck on your journey. ",

    "body": "Hey guys!\n\nI stared this journey on December 3rd, 2024 at 294.5 lbs. This morning, I weighed in at 240.5 lbs. In a mere 4 months time, I feel like I have completely improved my life, my ways, and my chance at a healthy future. I have struggled with my weight my entire life. Gone up, gone down, gone way back up, and now I'm here.\n\nA couple days before I satrted, I called my mom crying, saying I felt like I was on a downward spiral, unable to climb out. It's really daunting looking at needing to lose 150 lbs, seeing that it will take years. It feels like, at that point, that you've lost to obestiy. I seriously feared being 600 lbs by the time I was 25. My life was out of control. I had to have been eating 4000-5000 calories a day.\n\nI cut down to 1400 calories a day. I cut out breads, gluten, and sugar. I eat lots of protein and vegetables. It's funny how well that works, right? The same advice I've heard my entire life. I'm annoyed at how quickly the time has passed and how the pounds fell away, in the sense that I did so much damage to my body, lost so much time to the disease that is obesity. I am still obese, of course, but obesity is not going to win, and I am so thankful that this has been so simple and quick.\n\nI have around 100 more pounds to lose. I'm not really sure what my goal weight is since I've never weighed that little before. I know it should be around 140, but with loose skin, different muscle tone, you never know.\n\nAnyway, if you ever feel like you are losing the battle, it is so simple to get out of. It is mentally challenging to look at your life and identify that you're on a destructive path. If anyone feels like that, I'm here for you. We are all here for you. Thank you r/loseit for helping me get this far!",
