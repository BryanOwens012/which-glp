    "body": "Hello friends! If you see my post history, you'll see my journey through the posts here over the last 5 years.\n\nI am currently in a skilled nursing facility in Arizona, one that specializes in SMO patients, because in a matter of two short weeks, I finally became what I feared for 38 years: Immobile, unable to stand on my own two feet.\n\nIt started with resigning from my job last May, because I could no longer safely fit behind the wheel of my car, or operate the pedals due to my lymphedema, which I've had since 2007 but got much worse over the last 2 years. This was a job I fucking ***LOVED***, and I was damned good at it; I got to help young adults graduate college and prepare for successful lives after. I allowed myself to wallow for a week or two, then looked for remote work, which had varied but inconsistent levels of success. I kept eating, and eating, and ordering DoorDash, and not moving at all. I didn't shower for 3 months, I didn't leave my apartment for 6 months. My apartment became a disgusting graveyard of fast food bags, pizza boxes, and 2-liter sodas, because I definitely couldn't walk the 50 yards to the curb with my garbage can.\n\nI kept existing in this cycle of denial, self-hatred and guilt until early January, when it finally happened: I was no longer able to lift myself out of the armchair that I sat in 23 hours a day. I had no choice but to call EMT's, who strongly advised me to go to the hospital to have my lymphedema observed. Because my insurance didn't have coverage for PT and the hospital did not want me leaving the bed without PT's assurance that I could, I laid in bed for a week, 24/7. \n\nI'll never forget the first time I tried to stand after that week in bed. Back when I was healthier, I used to lift weights; I never felt that my legs were supporting my full weight, but now it felt like I was trying to squat 700 lbs. I just sat there, not knowing what to do next. I lived alone, I couldn't go back to my apartment if I couldn't walk.\n\nIf you're on this board, you know that being SMO makes ***everything*** more difficult, and that includes finding an SNF (skilled nursing facility) that has beds, hoyers, and staff capable of handling patients over 700 lbs. It was even harder to find one that had a bed open. FINALLY, I found one in Arizona, 3 time zones and 26 hours away from my family, my life. I had no choice, I worked with my parents to fund transport to Osborne Rehab.\n\nThe last 3 months have been a blur; I finally got approved for Arizona's long-term care insurance, and I am now getting PT 3x a week. With any hope, I'll be standing by the beginning of summer, walking by the fall, and ready to write the next chapter of my life by the end of 2026. In the meantime, I'll be looking for ways to pay the 15k of CC debt I incurred due to my DoorDash habit as well as the cost of remotely closing out the parts of my life in Florida (paying for a crew to trash out my apartment, getting my van running after sitting in park for 6 months so I can maybe sell it)\n\nHere's the good news: When I was admitted to the hospital I was over 820 pounds. This week I weighed in at 704. Now that I am moving more, it will hopefully accelerate the weight loss. My family has, for reasons I can't fathom, remained by my side and refused to give up on me.\n\nSo what's the lesson here?\n\n1) Delete the goddamned food delivery apps off your phone; if you're not able to cook, get a small air fryer and a Foreman grill, or find some things that you can fling onto a cookie sheet and put in the oven.\n\n2) If you don't move it, you lose it. And losing mobility is losing freedom. I cannot bathe, dress myself or wipe my own ass, and all three of those are things I thoroughly enjoyed doing a year ago. Make a plan, start with 500 steps, 1000 steps, but if you haven't lost mobility, take it from me: It. Fucking. Sucks.\n\n3) Write down all of the people, places, and experiences you love, and ask yourself, \"is food more important than this? Is food more important than missing USF win the AAC women's basketball championship, is it more important than your niece and nephew who love you almost as much as you love them? Is it worth losing all of the things that make life worth living?\". If the answer is yes, get some professional help, whether through support groups or therapy.\n\n  \nI appreciate y'all allowing me a few minutes to share my story, and I wish you all the best of luck in your journeys.",

With any hope, I&#39;ll be standing by the beginning of summer, walking by the fall, and ready to write the next chapter of my life by the end of 2026. In the meantime, I&#39;ll be looking for ways to pay the 15k of CC debt I incurred due to my DoorDash habit as well as the cost of remotely closing out the parts of my life in Florida (paying for a crew to trash out my apartment, getting my van running after sitting in park for 6 months so I can maybe sell it)</p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s the good news: When I was admitted to the hospital I was over 820 pounds. This week I weighed in at 704. Now that I am moving more, it will hopefully accelerate the weight loss. My family has, for reasons I can&#39;t fathom, remained by my side and refused to give up on me.</p>\n\n<p>So what&#39;s the lesson here?</p>\n\n<p>1) Delete the goddamned food delivery apps off your phone; if you&#39;re not able to cook, get a small air fryer and a Foreman grill, or find some things that you can fling onto a cookie sheet and put in the oven.</p>\n\n<p>2) If you don&#39;t move it, you lose it. And losing mobility is losing freedom. I cannot bathe, dress myself or wipe my own ass, and all three of those are things I thoroughly enjoyed doing a year ago. Make a plan, start with 500 steps, 1000 steps, but if you haven&#39;t lost mobility, take it from me: It. Fucking. Sucks.</p>\n\n<p>3) Write down all of the people, places, and experiences you love, and ask yourself, &quot;is food more important than this? Is food more important than missing USF win the AAC women&#39;s basketball championship, is it more important than your niece and nephew who love you almost as much as you love them? Is it worth losing all of the things that make life worth living?&quot;. If the answer is yes, get some professional help, whether through support groups or therapy.</p>\n\n<p>I appreciate y&#39;all allowing me a few minutes to share my story, and I wish you all the best of luck in your journeys.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

Occasionally I will throw in shrimp, a steak when I can afford it and during the holidays I ate a ton of ham and turkey because those meats were cheaper by the pound than anything else for sale.

There was no point where I was not hungry. I am also physically in better health even when I was at this weight before. I had terrible knee pain, that is gone now. I had lower leg swelling, severely, now it's almost completely gone. I used to get boils under my skin that would need to be popped, no more of that. So much more energy. I am actually sleeping at night so I'm not falling asleep randomly all day.\n\n  \nAnd just to be clear, I am not advocating for anyone else to be on this diet. Just relating what worked for me.

I looked at it and said we&#39;ll my teeth look good. </p>\n\n<p>My grandbabies are only going to be little for a short time. I hate that I don&#39;t have many pictures of me and my kids because of me not liking how I look. I don&#39;t want to do that with them.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t know the whole point of this post. Just know the people in the group would understand. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

My instinct was to just go home, but I forced myself to finish my drink and try to enjoy being out for a change. </p>\n\n<p>I am disappointed to say I used food to comfort myself when I got home. </p>\n\n<p>I would love to hear how you handle situations like this. It blows my mind that people behave like this, but I still end up blaming/hating myself when it happens (which thankfully isn’t very often).</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

    "body": "So as of today I have been on my diet for exactly 1 year. I am down 209lbs. \n\nI have my starting weight at 546lbs. but I'm positive it was more than that. 546lbs. was just the last official weight I had from a doctor's visit and it had been a year and half since that visit when I started and I know I weighed more. \n\nI was starting to grow out of my 5xl t-shirts, which is saying something because you know those stretch. I can now fit into a 2xl. Not well mind you. I look like a bursting sausage, but I can put them on.\n\nMy belt is down 19.5 inches. \n\nI am feeling so much better. I had severe lower leg swelling between my knee and ankle. That part basically looked like a cylinder and the medical compression garments I had did not work. Now I can wear just just the runner type compression garments and my legs look normal. I can even skip wearing them for a day with no visible swelling. \n\nI am so much stronger, doing things is so much easier. I no longer have to sit and use a chair when I do the dishes or cook. I am looking forward to mowing my lawn this year. Before this diet it took me 5-6 hours to mow my lawn. I would do it for about 8 minutes at a time with a 20 minute break and it would wipe me out for the rest of the day after that. The last time I mowed before winter it only took me 30-35 minutes without a single break and I was able to do other things after that. I used to carry all of my groceries in on one trip because I knew I wouldn't have the energy to make multiple trips. \n\n I can't believe I am 38lbs. away from being in the 200s. ",

    "title": "I lost 167 pounds naturally - I never thought life could be this good",
    "body": "Hey everyone,\n\nSo I wanted to just post something that I hope will help anyone feeling a little lost, or like their route to weight loss is getting a little tough.\n\nMarch 2023, I stepped on the scales for the first time in over a year. It flashed up. **345.5.** I was stumped. In shock perhaps. For reference, I was 26 at the time, and am **5'5 and a female**. I hit rock bottom, genuinely. Although I was crawling around there for a while.\n\nOutwardly, I was confident, referring to myself as 'fat', pretending to not care. Loud and funny, certain of herself.\n\nInwardly, I was dying. Walking more than 5 minutes caused severe back pain. I was always sweating, out of breath constantly. I couldn't breath at night due to the fat on my chest and around my neck. I hated leaving the house, going for a food shop, going for coffees, exploring a new town. Essentially, living life. Everything was beyond uncomfortable, it was painful.\n\nTo cope, I drank most weekend, partied to try and forget how much I hated the prison I was in. I had a job that had me on my feet all day, but the second I got through that door in the evening, I ate. Every day was centred around food. I followed the body positive movement (no hate, I believe no one should feel shame about their bodies), but it actually enabled me. I told myself 'nothing is wrong with me, it is okay to be fat'. And yes, morally there is nothing wrong with me. I am not a morally superior woman now than I was at 345.5 pounds. But that isn't the point. I wasn't living anymore. Online, I saw other fat women post themselves and they looked so confident. I thought that I wasn't trying 'hard enough' to love myself like they could.\n\nSo one day, I started counting calories, and I haven't stopped. I took it day by day, and thought, today, I am a little closer to a happier and healthier me. I started going for small walks, and these became longer and a little faster. I started talking to some trusted people about my feelings. I planned my next day. I then started thinking about how I could get more protein in, then more water.\n\nI celebrated the wins, and didn't beat myself up over any blips or 'stalls'. I forgot the timeline, and broke my weight loss into little chunks. I thought 'wow, can't wait to get into the next 10's of pounds (eg. 280 - 279), or the next stone bracket.\n\nI never stopped getting my hair done, or my nails done. I focused on wearing what I felt comfortable in for that day. I laughed, I listened to good music, drank good coffee, and started going on adventures again.\n\nI look back on myself from two years ago, and my initial reaction is 'god, how did I get there, I looked awful' I have had some people say similar things. But like with them, I stop myself and go, 'it was that version of me that took the first step, not this version of me. The only thing wrong with me was that I was lost'.\n\nI can't believe how good life is now. I have found pockets of happiness or content in the every day life, mostly! Because that is where the change is - in your day. Get today right, and you'll get to where you want to be. But please know, each day is one step closer. I am so delighted that I have taken that first step.\n\nThere were moments that I thought 'this is too hard, I want to live a little'. But living, to me, was learning some discipline and reaching for that delayed gratification instead of the instant kind. I am strong, resilient and capable of great things.\n\nPlease keep going, focus on the day, get it right and you can't go wrong.\n\nMy ultimate goal is 150, and I know I will get there. But I am focusing on today, and the next week so I can plan for anything that may be a challenge. I am excited. And always reminding myself of how my life has improved beyond my body.\n\nSome tips that have helped me:\n\n1. Plan out tomorrow. I know what I will have for each meal, along with when I will do my walk. I lay out my clothes for work, along with my walking clothes. I have meal prepped and everything is ready to go.\n2. Focus on the day. I keep saying it, but seriously. How can you make your day a successful one? What does that look like to you. It is easy for my mind to run and say 'oh my god, I have X pounds to lose still'. Okay yes that is true. But I am going to focus on today, as this will get me a little closer. I can focus on the inputs.\n3. Calorie tracking. Before losing weight, there were days I was CONVINCED I wasn't eating 'that' much. The modern body pos/fat movement convinced me that I was meant to be this way. I wasn't. I was eating so much junk food, that it didn't appear like a lot at times, and I was always 'hungry' for actual nutrition.\n4. Not every day will be perfect, that is okay. There have been days and periods of time (hello Christmas) where I wasn't eating in a caloric deficit, or going for my daily walk. That's okay, I just back to it. It is helpful to give yourself a time period of not tracking. Over Christmas, I chose the days overall where I wouldn't track. And I knew which days I was getting back to my normal routine. This helps a lot. Stick to it. I know that I am going away for a weekend next month. Friday and Saturday will not be tracked. That's okay. I am going for my food shop Sunday, I know what I like to eat on a weekly basis. Having a deadline for yourself is key!\n5. It's all about those habits. Doing something most days, such as your caloric deficit or your walk, will get you to where you want to be. It's simple, not easy. You don't need to do anything crazy, it's just a bit boring at times. Find comfort in that.\n6. Dress for the you TODAY. Don't stop taking care of yourself. Showing myself that I am a human that should always be treated with kindness and respect has really built up my self confidence. I used to have zero. I remind myself to walk with confidence. Some days are better than others. But this has really helped me to understand that there is no 'good' and 'bad' versions of myself!\n7. Take that focus away from your physical looks. I used to think 'I have to go for this walk to burn calories', and now I think 'I get to go on my walk, I feel good mentally and helps with my stress levels, those happy chemicals really help me!'\n8. Following/reading weight loss material that feels GOOD for you. I looked at what I was reading and who I was following. I don't want to have a super ripped or toned body. I wanted to find people, women especially that lost a lot of weight, and are realistic for me. This forum helps me to focus on the positive, and it's great seeing those who have walked before me.\n\nThanks for reading, any tips you would give? And again, not every day is perfect. I am always learning. But taking a break for a moment and looking back, I am so proud of myself. I am proud of all of you!",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nSo I wanted to just post something that I hope will help anyone feeling a little lost, or like their route to weight loss is getting a little tough.\n\nMarch 2023, I stepped on the scales for the first time in over a year. It flashed up. **345.5.** I was stumped. In shock perhaps. For reference, I was 26 at the time, and am **5'5 and a female**. I hit rock bottom, genuinely. Although I was crawling around there for a while.\n\nOutwardly, I was confident, referring to myself as 'fat', pretending to not care. Loud and funny, certain of herself.\n\nInwardly, I was dying. Walking more than 5 minutes caused severe back pain. I was always sweating, out of breath constantly. I couldn't breath at night due to the fat on my chest and around my neck. I hated leaving the house, going for a food shop, going for coffees, exploring a new town. Essentially, living life. Everything was beyond uncomfortable, it was painful.\n\nTo cope, I drank most weekend, partied to try and forget how much I hated the prison I was in. I had a job that had me on my feet all day, but the second I got through that door in the evening, I ate. Every day was centred around food. I followed the body positive movement (no hate, I believe no one should feel shame about their bodies), but it actually enabled me. I told myself 'nothing is wrong with me, it is okay to be fat'. And yes, morally there is nothing wrong with me. I am not a morally superior woman now than I was at 345.5 pounds. But that isn't the point. I wasn't living anymore. Online, I saw other fat women post themselves and they looked so confident. I thought that I wasn't trying 'hard enough' to love myself like they could.\n\nSo one day, I started counting calories, and I haven't stopped. I took it day by day, and thought, today, I am a little closer to a happier and healthier me. I started going for small walks, and these became longer and a little faster. I started talking to some trusted people about my feelings. I planned my next day. I then started thinking about how I could get more protein in, then more water.\n\nI celebrated the wins, and didn't beat myself up over any blips or 'stalls'. I forgot the timeline, and broke my weight loss into little chunks. I thought 'wow, can't wait to get into the next 10's of pounds (eg. 280 - 279), or the next stone bracket.\n\nI never stopped getting my hair done, or my nails done. I focused on wearing what I felt comfortable in for that day. I laughed, I listened to good music, drank good coffee, and started going on adventures again.\n\nI look back on myself from two years ago, and my initial reaction is 'god, how did I get there, I looked awful' I have had some people say similar things. But like with them, I stop myself and go, 'it was that version of me that took the first step, not this version of me. The only thing wrong with me was that I was lost'.\n\nI can't believe how good life is now. I have found pockets of happiness or content in the every day life, mostly! Because that is where the change is - in your day. Get today right, and you'll get to where you want to be. But please know, each day is one step closer. I am so delighted that I have taken that first step.\n\nThere were moments that I thought 'this is too hard, I want to live a little'. But living, to me, was learning some discipline and reaching for that delayed gratification instead of the instant kind. I am strong, resilient and capable of great things.\n\nPlease keep going, focus on the day, get it right and you can't go wrong.\n\nMy ultimate goal is 150, and I know I will get there. But I am focusing on today, and the next week so I can plan for anything that may be a challenge. I am excited. And always reminding myself of how my life has improved beyond my body.\n\nSome tips that have helped me:\n\n1. Plan out tomorrow. I know what I will have for each meal, along with when I will do my walk. I lay out my clothes for work, along with my walking clothes. I have meal prepped and everything is ready to go.\n2. Focus on the day. I keep saying it, but seriously. How can you make your day a successful one? What does that look like to you. It is easy for my mind to run and say 'oh my god, I have X pounds to lose still'. Okay yes that is true. But I am going to focus on today, as this will get me a little closer. I can focus on the inputs.\n3. Calorie tracking. Before losing weight, there were days I was CONVINCED I wasn't eating 'that' much. The modern body pos/fat movement convinced me that I was meant to be this way. I wasn't. I was eating so much junk food, that it didn't appear like a lot at times, and I was always 'hungry' for actual nutrition.\n4. Not every day will be perfect, that is okay. There have been days and periods of time (hello Christmas) where I wasn't eating in a caloric deficit, or going for my daily walk. That's okay, I just back to it. It is helpful to give yourself a time period of not tracking. Over Christmas, I chose the days overall where I wouldn't track. And I knew which days I was getting back to my normal routine. This helps a lot. Stick to it. I know that I am going away for a weekend next month. Friday and Saturday will not be tracked. That's okay. I am going for my food shop Sunday, I know what I like to eat on a weekly basis. Having a deadline for yourself is key!\n5. It's all about those habits. Doing something most days, such as your caloric deficit or your walk, will get you to where you want to be. It's simple, not easy. You don't need to do anything crazy, it's just a bit boring at times. Find comfort in that.\n6. Dress for the you TODAY. Don't stop taking care of yourself. Showing myself that I am a human that should always be treated with kindness and respect has really built up my self confidence. I used to have zero. I remind myself to walk with confidence. Some days are better than others. But this has really helped me to understand that there is no 'good' and 'bad' versions of myself!\n7. Take that focus away from your physical looks. I used to think 'I have to go for this walk to burn calories', and now I think 'I get to go on my walk, I feel good mentally and helps with my stress levels, those happy chemicals really help me!'\n8. Following/reading weight loss material that feels GOOD for you. I looked at what I was reading and who I was following. I don't want to have a super ripped or toned body. I wanted to find people, women especially that lost a lot of weight, and are realistic for me. This forum helps me to focus on the positive, and it's great seeing those who have walked before me.\n\nThanks for reading, any tips you would give? And again, not every day is perfect. I am always learning. But taking a break for a moment and looking back, I am so proud of myself. I am proud of all of you!",

I have the option to go up to the higher dose Wegovy should I need to.  I'm based in Ireland and was given lots of support from an obesity management service.  They work on best health rather than BMI.  That has been amazing, as well as giving me all the nutrition information, psychological support, and physio input I needed to live a healthier life.\n\nMobility improvements have been the biggest win.  I've gone from barely walking 50 metres with a rollator to doing 1km unaided.  Every day life is now possible.  I was housebound before, but now have travelled abroad a couple of times in the last few months.  The medication has also hugely helped my pain and inflammation from Lipedema. \n\nAt the moment my goal weight is 280.  This would mean a further loss of 108 lbs. That feels achievable in a year.  Ultimately though we'll see what happens.  So much has changed and improved for me, I'm enjoying every moment.  I'm even back to driving again.\n\nI've been quite lucky and pretty much no side effects.  I've responded really well to the medication, and TBH have not found it hard to follow dietician provided information around consuming a balanced diet.  The desire to eat in large quantities is entirely gone.\n\nI honestly cannot explain how much has changed in a year",

Had I, he would either be dead or bed ridden and close to death. The Intervention occurred in Jan 2024 and it was a success. He is down 160 lbs. He feels so much better and can walk without pain. He's a totally new person. He can live totally on his own again. He doesn't need help with basic daily tasks. Don't ever let strangers discourage you from offering help to someone. As I mentioned in that post, we would continue to love him no matter what he decided. This was NOT about shaming him. But several people here were convinced we were trying to control him. It was about offering him help to save his life. He could have refused it and we still would be in his life in the same positive way we always had been. He was NEVER upset or hurt about the Intervention. He and I now attend a weekly Zoom Meeting about Food Addiction. He was NEVER into meetings, but he absolutely loves this meeting and so do I. I'm so relieved he took the opportunity to heal and has implemented a healthy lifestyle.",

    "body": "I know lots of people worry about loose skin after significant weight loss, and I'm here to tell you that it's ok! \n\nI peaked at around 400lb (I don't know exactly - combination of denial and finding scales that go that high). 5ft 8, now 44 year old F, I had a gastric bypass in October 2021. My lowest weight post bypass was about 185lb, BMI of about 28. This is about the same as I weighed at about 11 years old!!!\n\nI am a naturally apple shaped individual - carry my weight around my middle, have a disproportionately small bottom and have always had an enormous bust (46L at my biggest)\n\nPost weight loss I am a size 8(US, 12UK) with a 34G bust. Needless to say this means I have a lot of loose skin and zero bum! \n\nI exercised but not excessively during my weight loss period - the biggest change for me was that I went from about 500 - 1000 reluctant steps per day to actually enjoying walking, and taking the opportunity to walk everywhere feasible, rather than automatically jumping in the car, even for the shortest of journeys. \n\nAnyway... My point. Loose skin. I have lots, it was a big fear of mine before weight loss, but I actually love it (well most of it!). Unsurprisingly, the worst of the loose skin is on my tummy. My breasts have disappeared to pockets of skin, and there is some loose skin on my inner thighs. I have a lot of loose skin on my upper arms. The worst area for me however is my saggy neck. \n\nOk I'm not selling this very well. \n\nI love most of my saggy loose skin. \n\nMy thighs have improved with time - I guess there is a bit of elasticity left in the skin in my thighs after all. \n\nI wear bra tops when I'm not wearing an actual bra. I have struggled with back ache from heavy breast tissue for a long time, and as my body shrunk, my tummy disappeared and it turns out my tummy had been acting as a shelf for my bust. I believe that the bra tops have helped my breast tissue to tighten up somewhat, and I feel it's helped the loose skin in that area. \n\nThe loose skin on my tummy... Well nothing but surgery is going to help that, and that's not an option right now or likely ever. So I've learned to love it. It didn't just happen overnight, rather it has been a process, but the reality is it's that it represents one hell of a journey for me.

The worst area for me however is my saggy neck. </p>\n\n<p>Ok I&#39;m not selling this very well. </p>\n\n<p>I love most of my saggy loose skin. </p>\n\n<p>My thighs have improved with time - I guess there is a bit of elasticity left in the skin in my thighs after all. </p>\n\n<p>I wear bra tops when I&#39;m not wearing an actual bra. I have struggled with back ache from heavy breast tissue for a long time, and as my body shrunk, my tummy disappeared and it turns out my tummy had been acting as a shelf for my bust. I believe that the bra tops have helped my breast tissue to tighten up somewhat, and I feel it&#39;s helped the loose skin in that area. </p>\n\n<p>The loose skin on my tummy... Well nothing but surgery is going to help that, and that&#39;s not an option right now or likely ever. So I&#39;ve learned to love it. It didn&#39;t just happen overnight, rather it has been a process, but the reality is it&#39;s that it represents one hell of a journey for me. The journey of a super morbidly obese 41 year old woman who became an average sized 44 year old woman who enjoys walking and going on adventures and has her life back, and who can easily hide her loose skin under her clothes 😍</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

Both of my parents underwent weight loss surgery when I was a kid, and the majority of the rest of my family are on the bigger side.\n\nDespite me being big my entire life, I am incredibly vain about my appearance. I always felt the need to overcompensate for my weight by always dressing well, having my makeup on, and having my hair done. And this has worked well for me...In the eyes of the public, I'm still fat, more of a more digestible version of being fat, because of the way that I carry myself and my appearance.\n\nThis phenomenon gave me reverse body dysmorphia, as I always felt smaller than I was. And I have largely ignored my weight and how I felt for years. When I began getting leg cramps just from walking around, I ignored it. How my blood sugar would randomly drop, I ignored it. How I would have to take deep breaths climbing the stairs, I ignored it. I have compounding health issues that exacerbate my weight as well, like PCOS. And still, I kept ignoring it. Why? Because I still had a full face of makeup on and cute outfits. I truly thought this is how normal young 20-somethings were supposed to feel.\n\nIt wasn't until I noticed myself buying exclusively 4-5x clothing from my favorite stores that it hit me. If I don't stop now, I won't be able to fit into anything. That thought was the only time my vanity was useful during the past 15 years of my life. I stripped naked and stared at my body to come to terms with how disfigured the weight made me. I have a severe apron belly and pretty bad back fat. My body proportions in clothes always hid those areas, so I never truly looked at them. I felt like I stumbled upon roadkill instead of my own naked body in that moment.\n\nLast month, I started eating in a calorie-deficient  (1.6k-1.2k calories), started a vitamin regimen (berberine is awesome!!!!!), and have been hitting my daily step goal of 5k steps (I hope I can double it at some point).

    "body": "This morning I finally hit it - I'm 200 lbs down!  Yeah!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Celebrate with me!!!  This has been a two and a half year journey.\n\nWhat started my journey:  I got long COVID, and suddenly I went from active and relatively normal life to feeling disabled and every pound that was on my body.  My blood sugars and asthma were out of control.  Two and a half years ago I started keto to control my blood sugars, not really thinking I would lose weight.  I lost a bit, and then I started Mounjaro, and the weight really started coming off.  Then I went back to the pool (I was an avid swimmer before the lockdowns) and the rest is history.  I still do keto, Mounjaro, and swim almost daily.  I average 1200 calories daily, eat 100+ g protein, and aim for at least 30 g fiber.  This is what I've found works for me best.  I have several food allergies so I mostly cook my own food.\n\nMy goals for the future:  I'd like to lose a bit more, but if I don't I'm happy here too.  I feel healthy and strong.  My weight loss has slowed to a very slow trickle now, so I don't know what's going to happen now.  I have a skin condition (HS) that requires skin surgeries (I've already had two on my armpits, having a third in a few weeks).  I am probably looking at a panniculectomy in the late spring and thighs and breasts sometime in the year or two after that.  After I have those surgeries I shouldn't lose much weight after that.  My doctor says a good weight for me would probably be a BMI of 27, and currently I'm at 29.4, so if I do lose a bit more by then I think it will be okay.  \n\nHow it feels:  amazing and different.  I forget I'm a smaller person.  I'll buy pants in the next size down (I'm currently wearing a size 14!) and I look at them thinking there's no way that they'll fit, and I go to put them on and they're not even tight!  I've been overweight and obese my whole life, I don't think I've been this weight since middle school.  I was so scale phobic I don't know for sure, but I was for sure over 200 in high school.  My body feels bony and strange, but I also feel confident and good to be able to wear different clothes.  If I see someone I haven't seen in a while they react in a surprised manner, and I met someone that had vaguely met me many years ago and I showed them picture of us at an event together and they didn't believe it was me. \n\nTips and tricks I've learned along the way:  When you're tempted to eat something off plan, eat something you like that is on your plan.  I do keto, so if I'm tempted by something like cake, I eat bacon or salmon or shrimp (some of my favorite foods).  It's easier to resist temptation when you're full of something you love.  I've also found some great sugar-free options, I make a killer keto chocolate chip cookie.  I've also learned to just keep going even if the scale doesn't move - it will move eventually.  One of the thoughts that helped me the most is that time will pass either way - it may as well pass with me getting healthier.  I think it's also good to pick a way of eating that works for you.  I chose keto because I really like the food, I feel good on it and I like what it's done for my blood sugars.  If you're on a plan that doesn't work for you, find one that does.  I chose exercise that I love too - it's a lot easier to get up to swim than any other exercise for me.\n\nThis page has been such a support to me in my journey, thank you to everyone who has been there along the way.  All of us are going to have bad days, stalls, temptations, and disappointments.  But we're all on this journey with our goal of health, and I appreciate that we can vent and celebrate and journey together.\n\n",

      "selftext": "This morning I finally hit it - I'm 200 lbs down!  Yeah!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Celebrate with me!!!  This has been a two and a half year journey.\n\nWhat started my journey:  I got long COVID, and suddenly I went from active and relatively normal life to feeling disabled and every pound that was on my body.  My blood sugars and asthma were out of control.  Two and a half years ago I started keto to control my blood sugars, not really thinking I would lose weight.  I lost a bit, and then I started Mounjaro, and the weight really started coming off.  Then I went back to the pool (I was an avid swimmer before the lockdowns) and the rest is history.  I still do keto, Mounjaro, and swim almost daily.  I average 1200 calories daily, eat 100+ g protein, and aim for at least 30 g fiber.  This is what I've found works for me best.  I have several food allergies so I mostly cook my own food.\n\nMy goals for the future:  I'd like to lose a bit more, but if I don't I'm happy here too.  I feel healthy and strong.  My weight loss has slowed to a very slow trickle now, so I don't know what's going to happen now.  I have a skin condition (HS) that requires skin surgeries (I've already had two on my armpits, having a third in a few weeks).  I am probably looking at a panniculectomy in the late spring and thighs and breasts sometime in the year or two after that.  After I have those surgeries I shouldn't lose much weight after that.  My doctor says a good weight for me would probably be a BMI of 27, and currently I'm at 29.4, so if I do lose a bit more by then I think it will be okay.  \n\nHow it feels:  amazing and different.  I forget I'm a smaller person.  I'll buy pants in the next size down (I'm currently wearing a size 14!) and I look at them thinking there's no way that they'll fit, and I go to put them on and they're not even tight!  I've been overweight and obese my whole life, I don't think I've been this weight since middle school.  I was so scale phobic I don't know for sure, but I was for sure over 200 in high school.  My body feels bony and strange, but I also feel confident and good to be able to wear different clothes.  If I see someone I haven't seen in a while they react in a surprised manner, and I met someone that had vaguely met me many years ago and I showed them picture of us at an event together and they didn't believe it was me. \n\nTips and tricks I've learned along the way:  When you're tempted to eat something off plan, eat something you like that is on your plan.  I do keto, so if I'm tempted by something like cake, I eat bacon or salmon or shrimp (some of my favorite foods).  It's easier to resist temptation when you're full of something you love.  I've also found some great sugar-free options, I make a killer keto chocolate chip cookie.  I've also learned to just keep going even if the scale doesn't move - it will move eventually.  One of the thoughts that helped me the most is that time will pass either way - it may as well pass with me getting healthier.  I think it's also good to pick a way of eating that works for you.  I chose keto because I really like the food, I feel good on it and I like what it's done for my blood sugars.  If you're on a plan that doesn't work for you, find one that does.  I chose exercise that I love too - it's a lot easier to get up to swim than any other exercise for me.\n\nThis page has been such a support to me in my journey, thank you to everyone who has been there along the way.  All of us are going to have bad days, stalls, temptations, and disappointments.  But we're all on this journey with our goal of health, and I appreciate that we can vent and celebrate and journey together.\n\n",

      "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>For those that are unaware, David was the star of a TLC documentary in 2009 which documented his weight loss with trainer Chris Powell starting in 2003 at 650lbs then getting down to 229lbs along with getting loose skin surgery.</p>\n\n<p>However, unfortunately he regained the weight getting back up to the 500lb range in 2012, throughout the 2010s he was in a constant battle with his weight eventually hitting a high point of 710lbs and appearing on an episode of Dr. Phil. He did manage to lose a lot of weight in 2020-2021, getting down to the mid 300s but unfortunately relapsed and regained a lot of it. He was put in hospice care in November 2023 after becoming bedbound, did make some progress and I believe was able to leave but unfortunately on the 11th of this month, his sister announced he passed away.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.dignitymemorial.com/obituaries/mesa-az/david-smith-12522705\">https://www.dignitymemorial.com/obituaries/mesa-az/david-smith-12522705</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@david630lbs/videos\">https://www.youtube.com/@david630lbs/videos</a></p>\n\n<p>I do wonder if he was given any proper mental health support on any of the interventions he had. From both the documentary and his appearance on Dr. Phil, childhood trauma and mental illness were the root cause of his addiction and it&#39;s vital for anyone struggling with weight to address the mental factor. I followed his journey since the early 2010s and it&#39;s incredibly sad it ended this way, I hope he was at peace and his family can get the support they need.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

    "title": "You’re not dead yet",
    "body": "Hola. \n\nHaven’t been here in a while. Been poking around and thought I’d reintroduce myself/share a bit of advice since I am seeing a lot of similar themes. \n\nStarted my journey December of 2022. I was on a trip home for the holidays, my wife and I visiting friends and family for the first time in six years and introducing them to our then four-year-old child. When I last saw them I was around 240 lbs at 5’7. I was visiting them at 380 lbs. \n\nThe trip was hell. Just getting through the air port was a struggle. I’d never had mobility issues but handling the suite cases, my daughter, hustling from luggage to security to the gate… I felt it a way I’d never felt it before. On the plane, I broke the armrest. I held it in place, terrified the flight attendant would notice and kick me off the flight, or de-board the entire plane. \n\nThen there was seeing friends. I could detect something in their faces. Not disgust. Worse. Sadness. They hadn’t seen me in years and they should have been excited. But I could see they were grieving me. I wasn’t dead yet but they were already writing my obituary in their minds, and I could read it in their eyes. \n\nVisiting my brother carried a whole other set of indignities. He’d just bought his first home, an older build. Carrying my luggage up the steep, uneven stairs to the guest room in the attic, he heard my huffing and puffing and asked if I wanted him to carry my bags. My younger brother was worried his big sibling couldn’t make it up the stairs. Later, when using the tiny bathroom on the ground floor, I discovered I couldn’t turn around in that narrow room without burning my thigh on the radiator.\n\nI was too big for my brother’s house. I was too big for the seat on the plane. I was too big for the world. \n\nLess than a week after retuning from the trip I went to the doctor for a check up. I’ve noticed something interesting over the years: once you get big enough, the doctors give up on you. They stop talking to you about your weight and health. Sometimes they will rattle off a script about blood pressure and diabetes but their eyes are glazed over. They’re talking AT you but not really engaged with you. Somtimes they don’t say anything at all. \n\nThis was one of those visits. Doctor didn’t even give me the “you need to lose weight” spiel. He just took my vitals and asked “anything else?” So this was my first real step. I had to ask him. I had to take action and acknowledge what the problem was and what I wanted. So I did. “I want to lose weight.” \n\nHe chuckled — not in a mean way — and said “calories in calories out.” I pushed a little harder, asking if there was some pill I could take, something I once swore I would never do. He talked about phentermine and told me he’d put me on it for a few weeks to see if it worked and if so, he’d renew the prescription. He also gave me a referral to a dietician. I said ok.\n\nI also started walking. Long walks with my dog. Thirty minute walks 5-6 days a week. \n\nMost importantly, I changed what I ate. No more snacks. No more beverages, besides water. No dessert. No more pasta, bread, or rice. No food between 6PM and 8AM. My dietician made me keep track of what I was eating, a food log. Calories in calories out. I was targeting 1800 calories a day. I went back to calculate what I’d been eating before and it was over 3500 calories a day. \n\nI lost +30 lbs in the first month. \n\nDue to some insurance nonsense I was unable to get the phentermine prescription renewed in a timely manner. By the time I was able to… I didn’t want it. I’d been going for two weeks without it and didn’t feel like I needed it. I never went back on it after the first 4 weeks. \n\nI built up my walks. Forty minutes. Forth five minutes. Fifty minutes. One hour. An hour fifteen. Ninety minutes. I stopped walking with my dog; I was going too far and too fast for him to keep up. \n\nEventually, walking 90 minutes wasn’t enough to break a sweat. It didn’t feel like it was getting my heart rate up. I didn’t have enough time to start walking even longer and I felt too heavy to run. So I started walking with weights: “rucking.” \n\nI kept to my new way of eating. Eventually I got comfortable enough to be more forgiving here and there, a couple meals on the weekends, special occasions. But day-in, day-out, the rules are roughly the same: no snacks, no dessert, nothing to drink besides water, no food after 6PM or before 8AM. Lots of salads. Lots of fruits and vegetables. Lots of yogurt. Lots of nuts. No bread/pasta/rice. Seafood, sometimes chicken, rarely red meat. \n\nThe first year I lost 100 lbs. From 380 to 280. \n\nThen I stumbled. Holidays were hard. Gained back 15 lbs between December of 2023 and May of 2024. From 280 to 295. I was going to slip back into the 300s if I wasn’t careful. \n\nAnd then I snapped out of it. Got back on the horse. Started losing again. \n\nStarted hiking. I did a 7 mile hike this weekend. Took me 4 hours. \n\nI had some ambitious goal weights and timelines in mind. I did not meet them. That’s ok. Today I’m 275. I am down 20 lbs from my “relapse” and more than 100 lbs from where I started. And I’m moving in the right direction. I’m going to make it to 50. I’m going to see my kid grow up. I’m going to live to see retirement. I’m going to keep losing weight and I will never give up. \n\nMy advice - stop mourning yourself. Stop grieving the life you think you’re losing before you’ve already lost it. You’re not dead yet. Take immediate action. Now. Don’t make excuses. Don’t wait until that pint of ice cream is polished off or that sleeve of cookies is done. Forget about them. They are gone. Throw it out if there’s no one else in your house who can eat them. \n\nCut calories. That doesn’t work? Count calories. That doesn’t work? Take drugs. That doesn’t work? Get the surgery. But goddamit fight. Fight for your life.\n\nDo you have kids? Do you want to see them grow up? Go to college? Get married? Or do you want them to look at a faded picture of you on the morning of their graduation wondering why you didn’t love them more than you love hot dogs? This was the nightmare image that shook me out of it. \n\nWillpower is an amazing thing we are all capable of. If there are people out there who can walk thousands of miles, endure excruciating pain, subject themselves to extreme deprivation and agony and mental and physical torture because they want to live… you are capable of cutting some calories if that’s what it takes to save your life. Yes. You can do it. Go see a doctor, go see a dietician, go see a therapist, whatever your path is: Do it. Start now, right now. ",

I said ok.\n\nI also started walking. Long walks with my dog. Thirty minute walks 5-6 days a week. \n\nMost importantly, I changed what I ate. No more snacks. No more beverages, besides water. No dessert. No more pasta, bread, or rice. No food between 6PM and 8AM. My dietician made me keep track of what I was eating, a food log. Calories in calories out. I was targeting 1800 calories a day. I went back to calculate what I’d been eating before and it was over 3500 calories a day. \n\nI lost +30 lbs in the first month. \n\nDue to some insurance nonsense I was unable to get the phentermine prescription renewed in a timely manner. By the time I was able to… I didn’t want it. I’d been going for two weeks without it and didn’t feel like I needed it. I never went back on it after the first 4 weeks. \n\nI built up my walks. Forty minutes. Forth five minutes. Fifty minutes. One hour. An hour fifteen. Ninety minutes. I stopped walking with my dog; I was going too far and too fast for him to keep up. \n\nEventually, walking 90 minutes wasn’t enough to break a sweat. It didn’t feel like it was getting my heart rate up. I didn’t have enough time to start walking even longer and I felt too heavy to run. So I started walking with weights: “rucking.” \n\nI kept to my new way of eating. Eventually I got comfortable enough to be more forgiving here and there, a couple meals on the weekends, special occasions. But day-in, day-out, the rules are roughly the same: no snacks, no dessert, nothing to drink besides water, no food after 6PM or before 8AM. Lots of salads. Lots of fruits and vegetables. Lots of yogurt. Lots of nuts. No bread/pasta/rice. Seafood, sometimes chicken, rarely red meat. \n\nThe first year I lost 100 lbs. From 380 to 280. \n\nThen I stumbled. Holidays were hard. Gained back 15 lbs between December of 2023 and May of 2024. From 280 to 295. I was going to slip back into the 300s if I wasn’t careful. \n\nAnd then I snapped out of it. Got back on the horse. Started losing again. \n\nStarted hiking. I did a 7 mile hike this weekend. Took me 4 hours. \n\nI had some ambitious goal weights and timelines in mind. I did not meet them. That’s ok. Today I’m 275. I am down 20 lbs from my “relapse” and more than 100 lbs from where I started. And I’m moving in the right direction. I’m going to make it to 50. I’m going to see my kid grow up. I’m going to live to see retirement. I’m going to keep losing weight and I will never give up. \n\nMy advice - stop mourning yourself. Stop grieving the life you think you’re losing before you’ve already lost it. You’re not dead yet. Take immediate action. Now. Don’t make excuses. Don’t wait until that pint of ice cream is polished off or that sleeve of cookies is done. Forget about them. They are gone. Throw it out if there’s no one else in your house who can eat them. \n\nCut calories. That doesn’t work? Count calories. That doesn’t work? Take drugs. That doesn’t work? Get the surgery. But goddamit fight. Fight for your life.\n\nDo you have kids? Do you want to see them grow up? Go to college? Get married? Or do you want them to look at a faded picture of you on the morning of their graduation wondering why you didn’t love them more than you love hot dogs? This was the nightmare image that shook me out of it. \n\nWillpower is an amazing thing we are all capable of. If there are people out there who can walk thousands of miles, endure excruciating pain, subject themselves to extreme deprivation and agony and mental and physical torture because they want to live… you are capable of cutting some calories if that’s what it takes to save your life. Yes. You can do it. Go see a doctor, go see a dietician, go see a therapist, whatever your path is: Do it. Start now, right now. ",

      "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hola. </p>\n\n<p>Haven’t been here in a while. Been poking around and thought I’d reintroduce myself/share a bit of advice since I am seeing a lot of similar themes. </p>\n\n<p>Started my journey December of 2022. I was on a trip home for the holidays, my wife and I visiting friends and family for the first time in six years and introducing them to our then four-year-old child. When I last saw them I was around 240 lbs at 5’7. I was visiting them at 380 lbs. </p>\n\n<p>The trip was hell. Just getting through the air port was a struggle. I’d never had mobility issues but handling the suite cases, my daughter, hustling from luggage to security to the gate… I felt it a way I’d never felt it before. On the plane, I broke the armrest. I held it in place, terrified the flight attendant would notice and kick me off the flight, or de-board the entire plane. </p>\n\n<p>Then there was seeing friends. I could detect something in their faces. Not disgust. Worse. Sadness. They hadn’t seen me in years and they should have been excited. But I could see they were grieving me. I wasn’t dead yet but they were already writing my obituary in their minds, and I could read it in their eyes. </p>\n\n<p>Visiting my brother carried a whole other set of indignities. He’d just bought his first home, an older build. Carrying my luggage up the steep, uneven stairs to the guest room in the attic, he heard my huffing and puffing and asked if I wanted him to carry my bags. My younger brother was worried his big sibling couldn’t make it up the stairs. Later, when using the tiny bathroom on the ground floor, I discovered I couldn’t turn around in that narrow room without burning my thigh on the radiator.</p>\n\n<p>I was too big for my brother’s house. I was too big for the seat on the plane. I was too big for the world. </p>\n\n<p>Less than a week after retuning from the trip I went to the doctor for a check up. I’ve noticed something interesting over the years: once you get big enough, the doctors give up on you. They stop talking to you about your weight and health. Sometimes they will rattle off a script about blood pressure and diabetes but their eyes are glazed over. They’re talking AT you but not really engaged with you. Somtimes they don’t say anything at all. </p>\n\n<p>This was one of those visits. Doctor didn’t even give me the “you need to lose weight” spiel. He just took my vitals and asked “anything else?” So this was my first real step. I had to ask him. I had to take action and acknowledge what the problem was and what I wanted. So I did. “I want to lose weight.” </p>\n\n<p>He chuckled — not in a mean way — and said “calories in calories out.” I pushed a little harder, asking if there was some pill I could take, something I once swore I would never do. He talked about phentermine and told me he’d put me on it for a few weeks to see if it worked and if so, he’d renew the prescription. He also gave me a referral to a dietician.

I weigh about 365, and actually that's about 20lbs less than I weighed a year ago, when I was her patient, so I'm not sure why this is suddenly an issue. She has always been kind, and a dentist I really liked. She told this to me kindly enough, but I still felt mortified and awful. I wasn't expecting that this morning. \n\nEdit: I contacted the dentist to say I was not coming back to the practice since they couldn't accomodate me. She said that she had a patient sue her recently because the chair collapsed while he was tipped back, which also damaged her legs when they were pinned by the chair. So, as some of you suspected, some liability issues at play here. I understand her caution, and yet, it still all sucks! ",

    "body": "I am currently 176lbs and had a start weight of 305lbs. I know 305 is a baby SMO in this sub, but it was debilitating for me in a similar way to what you might see in someone twice my weight. I couldnt stand for long at all, i needed walking aides, often at the end of the day my husband would have to half support my weight as much as he could just so i could get from the couch to the bedroom. Hygiene was getting really difficult for me and i was in constant pain both sciatic and general. \n\nCut to two months ago at 180lbs, good energy, good sleep, mental clarity, i no longer lean on food, I don't have feelings of shame or guilt when i eat, I'm not struggling with any mental battle with it at all. I am motivated, driven, a very high output kind of person. I work 9-5, come home, clean and cook, wash my three kids, etc. I sit with them at their bedtime and quietly read my books/browse social media for an hour or two, this is my only downtime and it doesnt bother me that this is all i get. I then spend about 10-20mins with my husband before showering and going to bed. In the new year, i had planned to join my local pilates place as I'd accidentally stumbled into an at home pilates set and loved it, and i enjoy morning workouts. This would mean a 5.30am start daily which I have no concerns about maintaining. \n\nCut to now. I've had shingles through christmas, triggered by my appendix having died and turning gangrenous. I did not have any symptoms of anything to do with my appendix until jan 9th, when i felt nauseas one morning and had abdominal pain the next day. 1 emergency surgery later, I'm back home with the knowledge they had to scramble and wash my abdomen out three times to get out all the side effects (trying to keep it PG lol) \n\nFor the first week i was in pain, but fine. Still not worried about foods, eating soft foods and high fibre to look after my gut. \n\nIn week 2 i started to slip into easier foods - getting to the kitchen to make healthy options is tough, so i found myself turning to custards, ice creams, junk foods. \n\nIn week three which is where we are, i find myself struggling with wanting to binge eat, chosing wholly junk food, turning to food to cope with the pain and reduced mobility, miserable and unable to sleep properly. \n\nAll this to say: \nYou are in pain. You are not sleeping properly. You are using a buttload of energy on the basics of life. You are both physically and mentally sore and exhausted - and that would get to EVERYONE. There are plenty of trainers who have done the 'gain weight and lose it again' challenge and those guys get vaugely overweight and struggle. The most motivated, healthy people on earth struggle with 1/6th of what you're dealing with ALL THE TIME. \n\nPlease be kind to yourself. Be pragmatic. Acknowledge the situation for what it is. You are self medicating with food. You are using food to run from pain and negative feelings about yourself, your life, your circumstances, the people around you. I used food to avoid being angry - i don't want to be an angry person and drive my loved ones away. \n\nYou cannot lose weight without acknowledging why you're here and what the food is doing for you, and find a way to replace that. It requires a certain selfishness at that size to look after youself. You need extra naps. You need to take it slow. You need more space and time. I had to take time outs in the worst of this - just walk away to the bedroom and leave my husband with the girls to try and regulate my nervous system instead of turning to food. I took two showers a day looking for reprieve. It was constant for about a month before i started managing to regulate a bit better, and now i can take deep breaths in the thick of my kids meltdowns and be okay. \n\nStop blaming yourself as if your circumstances aren't contributing. Acknowledge them with empathy and compassion, acknowledge they suck, acknowledge the hand you were dealt for right now is just not great, and then figure out how to play those cards anyway because your only other option is to fold and sit the game out. \n\nTake up something else you can do in the face of your pain and stress. Find a way to regulate your feelings and your physical body that isn't food. I chewed gum until i developed an intolerance lol. I drank coke zero until i had side effects. I took extra showers, or crawled into bed and did breathing exercises. I quit screens because they don't regulate you they just hit pause on disregulation\n\nYou may need therapy. You may need support. You will struggle to find what works for you and thats okay. Don't brush yourself off. Take pain meds when you need them. Try and get more sleep. Do what you can in terms of movement. I'm rooting for each and every one of you ❤️",

Acknowledge them with empathy and compassion, acknowledge they suck, acknowledge the hand you were dealt for right now is just not great, and then figure out how to play those cards anyway because your only other option is to fold and sit the game out. </p>\n\n<p>Take up something else you can do in the face of your pain and stress. Find a way to regulate your feelings and your physical body that isn&#39;t food. I chewed gum until i developed an intolerance lol. I drank coke zero until i had side effects. I took extra showers, or crawled into bed and did breathing exercises. I quit screens because they don&#39;t regulate you they just hit pause on disregulation</p>\n\n<p>You may need therapy. You may need support. You will struggle to find what works for you and thats okay. Don&#39;t brush yourself off. Take pain meds when you need them. Try and get more sleep. Do what you can in terms of movement. I&#39;m rooting for each and every one of you ❤️</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

    "body": "\nI don’t post much, but I feel like I need to put this out there, partly to hold myself accountable and partly because maybe someone else needs to hear it.\n\nI’m a super heavyweight man 29 years old in Canada. At my worst I reached 1,075 lbs. I’ve always struggled with food and alcohol addictio, but over the years it spiraled completely out of control. My body became my prison. My belly feels like an anchor, my legs and arms buried under layers of fat. I can barely shift my own weight in bed. I stopped walking completely. Even sitting up felt like climbing a mountain. I have two male assistants without whom I cannot function as a normal man currently.\n\nI nearly lost my life. Paramedics, resuscitations, my heart and lungs are giving out on me. Doctor told me straight: if I didn’t make a change, I wouldn’t be here much longer.\n\nSo I've started fighting. It’s only been a short while, but I’ve already lost 40 lbs. I know that might sound small compared to how big I still am, but to me it’s a spark of hope. Every pound is one step away from the grave I was digging for myself. I’ve had to relearn how to eat, how to face cravings, how to not give in when my brain screams at me to binge.\n\nI’m nowhere near where I need to be, but I’ve finally found some drive I didn’t think I had left. I want to live. I want to be able to stand on my own feet again, to breathe without gasping, to feel what it’s like to move freely.\n\nTo anyone else out there drowning in addiction, whether it’s food or anything else: I know how heavy it feels. I know the shame, the hopelessness. But if I can start clawing my way back at over a thousand pounds, then maybe you can too.\n\nHere’s to the next 40 lbs. And another. And another.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "I wish I could post a picture. If so, you’d see the MyWeigh XL-700 scale, one that many of us are familiar with as it has a 700 pound limit and is one of the few scales that go that high. And on that scale you’d see 398.6 pounds. \n\nI bought this scale maybe 15-20 years ago. I was 400+ pounds at the time, and no other scale worked. I’ve carried that around for 11 house moves, including 3 states and 2 countries. I’ve used it nearly every week in all those years, except for 2020 when I put on so much weight that I was scared to see. When I eventually checked myself in early 2021, I was up to 650 pounds. \n\nBut that scale was always there, and was always the one thing that could seem to hold my weight. I had a love/hate relationship with it. I loved that there was something made for me, that I knew I wouldn’t break, and it made me feel normal. But I hated it for the numbers it showed. For so many years it was a reminder of where I was, not where I wanted to be. \n\nI’ve lost a lot of weight over the last few years. Down 250 pounds, and today was the first time that I’ve been a weight that started with a “3” since I was in high school. In the 90s. A whole different millennium! As I’ve lost weight, I’ve used it daily, along with one of the fancy new scales that can handle 500 pounds. And I’ve just been waiting for the day when I landed in the 300s. And that day is today. :) \n\nI’m not sure what I’m doing to do with it. Donate it maybe (although it’s old and rusty!) Part of me wants the pleasure of throwing it in the trash, knowing I’m done with it. But whatever happens, it’s not going to stay in my house. \n\nJust sharing this because I know many are in the same boat. You can do this. A few years ago I needed a walker and cane to get around. I was terrified of breaking a toilet, and I barely left my house because I was scared that I wouldn’t “fit” in anywhere. Many of you get it. But today I have a different life, and it’s getting better every day. \n\nYou can do it too. I know you can. Because I’m doing it, and if *I* can, anyone can. \n\nGoodbye MyWeigh scale.

Well i forgot.\n\nI took a moment and looked at my car keys and thought about driving down there... you know that moment stops and you really want to make that easy choice.\n\nI didnt.\n\nI walked down there still.

It’s the hardest thing I have ever done. I have been working hard in therapy and in life. My depression and anxiety have improved. EMDR therapy for trauma is next. I don’t know if I will reach my weight goal by the end of the year, but I will do my best until then and accept the outcome. My NSVs have changed my life in ways I could never imagine. I look forward to more of them as I get stronger.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

I'm just Extremely Morbidly Obese 😅 but a win is a win. 83lbs down in a 200lb weight loss journey. My next big goal is to lose 100lbs in a year which is coming up on October 1st. I have 62 days to lose 17lbs. I used a GLP1 for the first 35ish-lbs but decided to come off it in early Spring. I eat 1500 calories/day and do absolutely **zero** stereotypical planned or scheduled exercise (this is a hot take I know). Turns out, I don't have to join a gym and do cardio to lose weight, this was a HUGE hurdle for me in previous attempts. I have however slowly and naturally become much more active with my partner. We bought a paddleboard, we hike most weekends, take walks together after work. I just do what feels good and natural as it comes along. I can even stand on the paddleboard for over a minute now before I eat sh\\*t into the water!\n\nMy BMI has gone down 12 points, I sleep better, my skin is clearer, movement no longer feels like a chore.\n\nI have found so much success focusing on my calorie deficit and volume eating. I eat pasta for dinner and an ice cream bar every night, I never feel hungry or deprived! People are finally starting to notice the physical differences, my clothes are definitely feeling looser now. After I achieve this upcoming goal, the next big goal will be to lose another 50lbs in 7mos! Next April I'm going to Mexico with a big group of friends. Picturing myself on the beach at 220lbs seems totally surreal but for the first time in my life I'm confident that it's going to happen. We took a trip to Sedona in April and I didn't need the seatbelt extender I asked for. I can't believe it's happening for me, I can't believe I'm making it happen!\n\nPlease remember we are all worthy of love and respect at every size. Thank you to everyone who has been so supportive during this journey, I hope I can pay it forward",

    "body": "So  at the end of August 2024 I weighed in at 5'4 and 419lbs. \n\nI had a BMI of over 70 and I knew if I didn't sort myself out my weight would kill me.\n\nI have always been obese, I did sliming world and weight watchers since age 12. I have lost weight before (always up to 4 months) would make massive progress (50lbs+ drop) then I'd fail and regain the weight.\n\nI had booked a trip to theme park a year and a bit in advance (Disney and universal). when I went to universal last around 350lbs I hardly fit on anything. this was a lot of money for me to book coming from the UK.\n\n  \nSo 1st September 2024 I began calorie counting. I set myself a target of 1750 calories a day but I also promised to be honest with myself. If I had a bad day and went over that was OK as long as I logged it. this helped me see the bigger picture as before I'd have a bad day and that would cause me to spiral and diet to fail. By taking this approach I was able to see my monthly/weekly calories and see how just having a 'bad' day every now and then was ok as it all balanced out overall provided I kept tracking and got back on track.\n\nIn November 2024 I hit a platue for a month and given my size I wasn't pleased about hitting it so early into my journey so in December 2024 I started Mounjaro alongside counting and the scales have kept moving since. \n\nI have not been perfect at all, I've sometimes had months were I've had 3 'bad' weekends in it due to parties or being on holiday. but I've always logged no matter what (almost got the 365 day streak on my app).\n\n  \nI also implemented weighing every Friday and after weighing, no matter the results, taking myself out for a coffee as a treat. I want to keep doing this even after I've finished my journey so I can make sure my weight doesn't spiral. \n\nNow for the results:\n\nSW 419\n\nCW 273lbs \n\n  \nPrevious BMI - 71.9\n\nCurrent BMI - 46.9\n\n  \nMeasurements \n\nSW Hips - 63\n\nCW hips - 49\n\n  \nSW waist - 55\n\nCW waist - 38\n\n  \nFuture plans and thoughts\n\n  \nSo I'd like to lose as much weight as possible pre-holiday and just carry on as I am.\n\nDuring my 2 week holiday I'm gonna log 4k calories on my app per day to make sure I don't lose my streak as I've learnt I'm very number motivated and then get back on track when its finished.\n\nMy current thing I'm struggling with is setting a goal weight as I think I have quite a bit of muscle for carrying so much weight from being SMO basically since childhood.

    "body": "HW/SW: 775+\nCW: 725.0\nCGW: 700\nUGW: 225ish\n\nHi all, just wanted to give you a bit of an update on my life as I know it’s been a while. \n\nI’ve been having some very solid success. I started at over 775 pounds and my quality of life was absolutely horrible. I’m not going to sit here and say that it isn’t bad now, but I am 50 pounds lighter and life is slowly getting easier. \n\nI now weigh 725 pounds. My current goal weight is 700. I promise you, the second I see the first number on that scale hit “6”, I’m going to cry. \n\nI had long since given up on my life and stopped caring for the longest time. I didn’t care about what went into my body or how I used it. I didn’t care about living, about myself, about anything. I was content with eating myself to literal death.\n\nAfter a health scare nearly killed me in December, I had a great talk with one of the inpatient nurses taking care of me at the time and it ended in me realizing how serious things are for me and that I really didn’t want to die this way.\n\nI went to the doctor in January after finding out my A1C was high enough (6.7) to consider me diabetic. I’ve never taken insulin or been considered diabetic or anything, so while this was bittersweet news to me. Being diabetic sucks, but it also means that my insurance will cover medicines like Mounjaro. That stupid shot has been a lifesaver. My eating habits have completely changed as well. \n\nI’ve been doing intermittent fasting with a 18:6 ratio and making sure that what I put into my body isn’t just straight junk. Do I miss the comfort food? Sure, sometimes. The inability to walk to the bathroom without feeling like I just hocked up a lung? No. The inability to take daily showers because of how hard it was on my body? No. I’m showering every day and feeling so much better. Truly. Even at my size, healthier living has helped me so much. Turns out, the more you respect your body the more it respects you.\n\nIt’s no secret that I have a long way to go, but damnit I’m on my way there! ",

I started at over 775 pounds and my quality of life was absolutely horrible. I’m not going to sit here and say that it isn’t bad now, but I am 50 pounds lighter and life is slowly getting easier. </p>\n\n<p>I now weigh 725 pounds. My current goal weight is 700. I promise you, the second I see the first number on that scale hit “6”, I’m going to cry. </p>\n\n<p>I had long since given up on my life and stopped caring for the longest time. I didn’t care about what went into my body or how I used it. I didn’t care about living, about myself, about anything. I was content with eating myself to literal death.</p>\n\n<p>After a health scare nearly killed me in December, I had a great talk with one of the inpatient nurses taking care of me at the time and it ended in me realizing how serious things are for me and that I really didn’t want to die this way.</p>\n\n<p>I went to the doctor in January after finding out my A1C was high enough (6.7) to consider me diabetic. I’ve never taken insulin or been considered diabetic or anything, so while this was bittersweet news to me. Being diabetic sucks, but it also means that my insurance will cover medicines like Mounjaro. That stupid shot has been a lifesaver. My eating habits have completely changed as well. </p>\n\n<p>I’ve been doing intermittent fasting with a 18:6 ratio and making sure that what I put into my body isn’t just straight junk. Do I miss the comfort food? Sure, sometimes. The inability to walk to the bathroom without feeling like I just hocked up a lung? No. The inability to take daily showers because of how hard it was on my body? No. I’m showering every day and feeling so much better. Truly. Even at my size, healthier living has helped me so much. Turns out, the more you respect your body the more it respects you.</p>\n\n<p>It’s no secret that I have a long way to go, but damnit I’m on my way there! </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

Being double digits in kgs does feel like a big milestone, since it is the measurement used where I live. When I look back at my starting point, I feel grateful for my progress. I'm very short at 5'1\" so technically that was 3 times a weight at the lower end of my healthy weight range. I had to rest in the middle of a shower because it was exhausting to stand that long. I sweat profusely walking the length of a city block. I pulled a muscle wiping myself. I ended up in the hospital several times with precursory signs of a heart attack or stroke. I live in a very fat-shaming culture, so I was invisible and every problem I had was blamed on my weight. I had no voice.\n\nI am doing much better now. I can walk and move. I still have a lot of work to do, but it feels possible that I can become healthy and fit. The most important part of the work I have done and have yet to do is work on my mental health and my relationship with food. I know that every pound I gained has a story full of pain or trauma. Unpacking it all and processing it is the hardest thing I have ever done or will do. I also found my voice.\n\nMy goal for 2025 is to finish losing the weight and get to 150 lbs, and then start seriously researching surgeons for loose skin removal. I will probably update again in a few months with my first update of 2025. I am so grateful for this sub and all of the vulnerability and information shared here. You all have helped me a lot during the process. Thank you.  \nHappy New Year!",

    "body": "At my heaviest, just over two years ago, I was 22st7lb/315lb/143kg. I’m only 5’3. On a family holiday I had to fly with a seatbelt extender for the first time, and reaching that point, along with not being able to walk for 15 minutes at a time while on that trip, made me realise that something had to change. I’ve always struggled with my weight but slowly but surely between 2020 and 2023 I went from fat to my-health-is-in-serious-danger-fat.\n\nSince then, I’ve lost around 60lbs, taking my BMI from ~55 to ~44. It’s not exactly rapid weight loss, and that’s made it hard for me to realise my body’s changed (or at least easy for me to deny it to myself). \n\nToday, I got on a flight to go on holiday with my fiancé, sat in my plane seat and buckled the seat belt without an extender, and even managed to lower my tray table. I started crying immediately because I realised this is undeniable proof that I’m smaller than I used to be. I spent the flight comfortable and able to enjoy my book, not constantly squirming to try and find a remotely comfy position. \n\nAs well as my aviation-based win, for the last three months I’ve had regular, manageable periods after years of no bleeding for months followed by weeks on end of horrifically heavy bleeding. I can walk for (pretty much) as long as I want, and today actually walked faster than my (fit, healthy, normal weight) fiancé up a hill. \n\nI suppose I just wanted to say that if you’re struggling to see that you’ve lost weight, like me, it doesn’t mean you haven’t. It means that it’s hard to see gradual changes on yourself, especially when many of us have a tendency to be overly self-critical. Looking back at photos I’m starting to realise I actually have major face gains, and I’m so excited to see where I might be this time next year. ",

    "body": "Like most of you guys I have tried literally everything. My mom put me on phentermine in middle school, slim fast, weight watchers, eating 500 calories/day on HCG, keto, intermittent fasting bla bla. You name it, I've tried it. I've never stuck with anything for long, would lose 10lbs and immediately \"fail\" at whatever diet I was trying. Then I got cancer (whoops) and lost my thyroid, gained 100lbs overnight 5 years ago. Since then I've steadily continued to gain. Over the summer my in-law's invited us to Mexico. All we had to do was pay for our flights... and this terrified me. Realizing I was going to have to vacation in a swimsuit, be on a plane for hours, keep up with a family of fit people (my mother in-law loves to make comments about fat people, you know the type) was so scary. The fact that this incredible opportunity was horrifying to me, was really the biggest wake up call.\n\nI immediately started doing research on \"how to lose weight fast\" and found the CICO sub reddit. I calculated my TDEE, found my maintenance calories, and decided to go on a 1400 calorie/day deficit, which happened to be 1400 calories/day. Everyone told me this was too extreme, everyone told me this wasn't sustainable, everyone told me I would fail. It took some trial and error, I had some really hungry days, I made some mistakes, and I went on ozempic after the first month. I kept at it, every single day. I ate over my deficit on Thanksgiving, Christmas Eve, Christmas, and New Years Eve. Only 4 of the 151 days from October - March were outside of my deficit. I lost 50lbs in that time, FIFTY. Sometimes I can't even believe it, sometimes it feels so surreal it's hard to even grasp the concept.\n\nI went to Mexico, 50lbs lighter. I felt more mobile, I felt beautiful, I felt secure, the flight was painless, my hubby and I snorkeled together for hours. It was the most beautiful and magical trip I've ever been on. And now I'm one month back from Mexico and I'm still going. I've increased my daily calories from 1400/day to 1500/day and I've lost another 5lbs this month with one more week to go. I came off of Ozempic this month, my doctor advised against it. She said most people who come off of it regain all their weight. But I know that's not going to happen, for some reason I just know it. It feels different this time. She has no reason to believe that, but I feel so confident in my ability to stay in my deficit I know there's nothing that's going to de-rail me. I have never felt this confidence before, the security or the stability. I know it in my bones that this is the one. I can do this on my own. The ozempic helped me when I didn't feel as secure, but now that I have that feeling I know I can do it by myself.\n\nWe are planning another trip to Costa Rica this coming summer, it should land right around when I'm hitting 90lbs gone. I'm booking trips, buying hiking shoes, shopping for swimsuits. I'm doing things \"normal\" people take for granted and it feels SO GOOD. I can't wait to travel the world and not feel marginalized or ashamed while I'm doing it. I still have quite a long way to go but I am officially over 25% of the way to my goal. It's surreal, it's shocking, I just cannot believe it's actually happening. But it's happening! If I can do this, truly anyone can.\n\nSW: 372 CW: 317 GW: 172  \n33F 5'9  \nHappy as can be",

But I’m seeing things differently now that I’m a bit removed from it, and I’m not going to give up ☺️</p>\n\n<p>HW: 456\nCW:370\nGoal: 185-200</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

I was so proud of myself. \n\nI looked at my watch and I did about 3500 steps at this event. Not out of breath, legs not tired, it was like it was nothing. \n\nI still have a SMO brain so sometimes I will sit down and rest when walking long distance even though I'm not tired. Im just so used to having limitations and as that fade away with fat loss I have to retrain my brain. But I did not do that today. It was zip zip eveywhere. I have errands to do later today and some house cleaning and I still have a ton of energy. \n\nThere is just so much freedom in being able to go anywhere your legs can take you. Also I didn't have to worry about where I would sit at the event, any chair would do.
