    "body": "50M/T2D/SW:337/CW:189/GW:175\n\nJuly 8, 2024 I started this journey.  I had been diagnosed in 202: with T2D when my A1C came back 9.8.  I made changes & was doing good until I fell back into bad eating habits in December 2023 & ballooned up to 337 lbs.  I made major changes to diet & sleeping habits when I first started MJ back in July 2024.  I will say I was a quick responder to the medicine & weight started to come off quickly.  On the diet changes I prioritized protein, upped my fruits & vegetable intake, & cut out anything with added sugars.  Kept my carbs low as well.  I also started walking consistently about two months in to my journey.  Decided needed to go to bed earlier at consistent time as life allowed & that has been a huge health benefit.  About six months in started doing some circuit training & upping my walking.  My son convinced me to do a 5k race at end of February & have done total of three 5K races with him now.  Did my first 10K June 29 at Pictured Rocks 50th annual road race & finished it in one hour & ten minutes.  Training for my first half marathon at the BMW Dallas Marathon race December 14.\n\nMy A1C has been at 5.2 or below for over six months now.  Doctor took me off metformin completely.  No longer have to sleep with CPAP.  Blood pressure & cholesterol are perfect.  All other health markers the doctor checks are perfectly normal.  I have reclaimed my health & it feels absolutely amazing.\n\nAs you can imagine I feel so much more confident in my own skin now.  I went from 3xl/4xl shirts to wearing medium shirts.  I don’t avoid the camera like the plague like I used to.  I have energy in buckets & am so much more active than I was.  I smile so much more now.\n\nThe shot along with other changes I have been consistent in making have help me change the trajectory of my life health wise.  I will remain vigilant & consistent with these new habits as I continue toward my GW & enter to the hardest part maintaining.  Be intentional with making good changes.  Be consistent in making those changes a daily choice & routine.  You will see results that will make you smile.\n\nBig shout out to this awesome forum of people that have given so much great advice & inspiration.  My journey continues with all of you.\n\n",

I had been diagnosed in 202: with T2D when my A1C came back 9.8.  I made changes &amp; was doing good until I fell back into bad eating habits in December 2023 &amp; ballooned up to 337 lbs.  I made major changes to diet &amp; sleeping habits when I first started MJ back in July 2024.  I will say I was a quick responder to the medicine &amp; weight started to come off quickly.  On the diet changes I prioritized protein, upped my fruits &amp; vegetable intake, &amp; cut out anything with added sugars.  Kept my carbs low as well.  I also started walking consistently about two months in to my journey.  Decided needed to go to bed earlier at consistent time as life allowed &amp; that has been a huge health benefit.  About six months in started doing some circuit training &amp; upping my walking.  My son convinced me to do a 5k race at end of February &amp; have done total of three 5K races with him now.  Did my first 10K June 29 at Pictured Rocks 50th annual road race &amp; finished it in one hour &amp; ten minutes.  Training for my first half marathon at the BMW Dallas Marathon race December 14.</p>\n\n<p>My A1C has been at 5.2 or below for over six months now.  Doctor took me off metformin completely.  No longer have to sleep with CPAP.  Blood pressure &amp; cholesterol are perfect.  All other health markers the doctor checks are perfectly normal.  I have reclaimed my health &amp; it feels absolutely amazing.</p>\n\n<p>As you can imagine I feel so much more confident in my own skin now.  I went from 3xl/4xl shirts to wearing medium shirts.  I don’t avoid the camera like the plague like I used to.  I have energy in buckets &amp; am so much more active than I was.  I smile so much more now.</p>\n\n<p>The shot along with other changes I have been consistent in making have help me change the trajectory of my life health wise.  I will remain vigilant &amp; consistent with these new habits as I continue toward my GW &amp; enter to the hardest part maintaining.  Be intentional with making good changes.  Be consistent in making those changes a daily choice &amp; routine.  You will see results that will make you smile.</p>\n\n<p>Big shout out to this awesome forum of people that have given so much great advice &amp; inspiration.  My journey continues with all of you.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

Today, I’m 177.</p>\n\n<p>I could cry just writing that, because for so long, I didn’t think I’d ever get back here. I went through chemo, radiation, 6 months of infusion chemo, a double mastectomy, 30 days of radiation, 6 more months of oral chemo, and a full year of immunotherapy. My body was wrecked. My hormones were out of control. I was inflamed, exhausted, and constantly hungry, like I could never get full.</p>\n\n<p>I tried everything. I blamed myself. I felt broken. And then I found Mounjaro.</p>\n\n<p>This medication saved my life. It gave me my sanity back. It quieted that constant mental noise about food. It helped rebalance the hormones my body just wasn’t producing anymore, just like a diabetic needs insulin when their pancreas stops working, we need help when our hunger and fullness signals stop working. It’s not cheating. It’s not a shortcut. It’s medicine.</p>\n\n<p>Since starting Mounjaro, I’ve lost 73 pounds. I eat more protein. I drink more water. I walk more. I sleep better. But more than anything, I feel like myself again. I’m present with my kids. I’m active. I’m hopeful. I’m me.</p>\n\n<p>To anyone out there struggling, please know this: it is not your fault. You are not weak. You deserve to feel good in your body. And with the right support, healing is possible.</p>\n\n<p>I’ll shout it from the rooftops: Mounjaro works. And I am so, so grateful.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

I started because I really wanted to make a change as I wasn’t happy with my health or body it wasn’t easy and took discipline and hard work and I managed to lose the weight. I stopped taking Mounjaro end of September and have maintained my weight since, I am more conscious about what I put in my body and have regained a confidence that I lost a long time ago. Anyone who is worrying about coming off, if you keep that same determination and discipline you have while on it and continue that then you will have no problem. We all have a cheat meal but balance is important. This is a year of weddings and hens for me and I feel so grateful to be able to get dressed up with my friends and feel like a whole different person. 🤗 Can’t believe how much my life has changed in a year ❤️</p>\n\n<p>Your Transformation Stats\n    • Starting weight: 67.2 kg (148.2 lbs)\n    • Current weight: 46.8 kg (103.2 lbs)\n    • Weight loss: 20.4 kg (45 lbs)\n    • Height: 148 cm\n    • Starting BMI: 30.7 (Obese Class I)\n    • Current BMI: 21.4 (Healthy </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

Not because I eat more, but because I’m buying berries, fresh vegetables, yogurt and I eat it all first.\n\nI now own three times as many mirrors as I used to. I kept “accidentally” buying them.\n\nI’ve turned into a total data nerd. I track every meal, exercise, water and pooping - the works. I even take progress pics with every weigh-in (and no, I’m not posting them, even if it would rake in the upvotes). My meagain app and widget has been my secret sauce (no pun intended), somehow motivating instead of obsessive. Only regret is not using an app from the beginning.\n\nI get way more random conversations in public. Strangers suddenly want to \"chat\". Pre-weight loss, this never happened.\n\nShopping takes forever. Not because I’m hunting for my size, but because I keep grabbing clothes thinking “there’s no way this fits\" and it does.\n\nI have so much energy now that my partner is begging me to sit still while I’m bouncing from one random home project to another.\n\nMy caffeine tolerance tanked. One cup of coffee now has me buzzing around like a hummingbird on an espresso drip.\n\nMy water bill went up because bubble baths take forever to fill when you’ve got room to actually stretch out in the tub.  \n  \n  \nI’m beyond grateful for how far I’ve come. Tirzepatide/GLP1 has given me parts of my life back I didn’t even realize were missing. The weight loss feels amazing and logging/tracking/reporting everything in my meagain account has made the the lifestyle changes feel like the biggest win.\n\nLife feels different now.

Got worse after my pregnancy of course, but I remember when I was around 15 years old (i’m 40 now), my aunt joked about her belly and said she had 4 chickens in there. I always feared I’d have the same fate as her, sadly she passed away from a diabetic foot gangrene at 50 years old :( You can probably imagine my disbelief when I saw my flat tummy in the mirror yesterday. In Aug 2024, I had 30kg of fat in my abdominal area. Now I have 11kg. My visceral fat rating went from 20 to 9. Just sharing to support those who are just starting on their journey. Trust the process! 💪</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

Over 7-8 months, I’ve gone from 111kgs-66kgs (244lbs to 145lbs). AU size 20 to AU sz. 12. I was motivated to lose the weight for my health and because of a trip to Europe with my teenage daughter. It was so liberating to fit comfortably into the plane seat, wear beautiful clothes, go kayaking and swimming, walk for endless hours around European cities, take full length photos and not be horrified by my size, all of which I could not/would not have done without this life-changing weight loss that I attribute much of my success to Mounjaro for appetite control (I went up to 7.5mg). The rest was my efforts, completely overhauling my diet and eating clean and healthy. All the best to everyone on this journey. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

    "body": "I’m down 115 lbs since starting GLP-1 medication - I lost 20 lbs before beginning in December 2023.\n\nI am beyond ecstatic to finally reach my weight loss goals and dreams. It's been a lifelong journey with ups and downs over approximately 15 years.\n\nWhen I lost the weight, I found huge inspiration in others who were willing to share their journey.

It’s been a long road—hard work, sweat, growth, healing.</p>\n\n<p>But then I saw the word “normal” on the chart and… it hit weird. Like, was I “abnormal” before? Less worthy? Less human?</p>\n\n<p>Proud of myself—but also unpacking the weight that word carries. Just sharing in case someone else out there gets it.</p>\n\n<p>Disclaimer for full transparency:\nI started Monjaro in July last year. Since then, I’ve been doing a lot of sports—training 4 to 5 times a week, lots of cardio, and daily walking (I live in a super walkable city: Berlin). I also completely changed my diet. I’ve been on the maintenance dose since January, taking half of 12.5mg every 2–3 weeks. But now, I’ve officially stopped.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

I got diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes in the summer of 2022. My highest weight was 253lbs. I was immediately prescribed metformin because my A1C was 8.2. The metformin helped me lose weight and brought my A1C down and it is now technically in remission. I started taking Mounjaro in June of 2024, my weight was 219lbs. I am now 165lbs, 12lbs away from my goal weight. I have lost almost a total of 88lbs. I have lost 54lbs since starting Mounjaro. To say that I am speechless and proud is the understatement of the century. I never in a million years thought I would get to this stage of my life. I still struggle to grasp that I’ve arrived. I still see the girl I was in that first image but logically I know that I’m the girl in the last photo. I struggle with body dysmorphia very badly but I am working on it. I cannot begin to express how blessed and grateful I am to have been able to go on this journey, especially with all of you beautiful souls. You all give me courage and strength to keep going and I feel incredibly privileged to be a part of this amazing community. Thank you all for coming along on this journey with me and I wish you all the best success!! We’ve got this!! ❤️❤️😘\n",

The metformin helped me lose weight and brought my A1C down and it is now technically in remission. I started taking Mounjaro in June of 2024, my weight was 219lbs. I am now 165lbs, 12lbs away from my goal weight. I have lost almost a total of 88lbs. I have lost 54lbs since starting Mounjaro. To say that I am speechless and proud is the understatement of the century. I never in a million years thought I would get to this stage of my life. I still struggle to grasp that I’ve arrived. I still see the girl I was in that first image but logically I know that I’m the girl in the last photo. I struggle with body dysmorphia very badly but I am working on it. I cannot begin to express how blessed and grateful I am to have been able to go on this journey, especially with all of you beautiful souls. You all give me courage and strength to keep going and I feel incredibly privileged to be a part of this amazing community. Thank you all for coming along on this journey with me and I wish you all the best success!! We’ve got this!! ❤️❤️😘</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

I got diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes in the summer of 2022. My highest weight was 253lbs. I was immediately prescribed metformin because my A1C was 8.2. The metformin helped me lose weight and brought my A1C down and it is now technically in remission. I started taking Mounjaro in June of 2024, my weight was 219lbs. I am now 165lbs, 12lbs away from my goal weight. I have lost almost a total of 88lbs. I have lost 54lbs since starting Mounjaro. To say that I am speechless and proud is the understatement of the century. I never in a million years thought I would get to this stage of my life. I still struggle to grasp that I’ve arrived. I still see the girl I was in that first image but logically I know that I’m the girl in the last photo. I struggle with body dysmorphia very badly but I am working on it. I cannot begin to express how blessed and grateful I am to have been able to go on this journey, especially with all of you beautiful souls. You all give me courage and strength to keep going and I feel incredibly privileged to be a part of this amazing community. Thank you all for coming along on this journey with me and I wish you all the best success!! We’ve got this!! ❤️❤️😘</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

I&#39;m 5&#39;7. I never realized how big I actually was until looking at old pictures. It&#39;s crazy how I never realized I was actually fat because I thought I still looked the same as I used to when I wasn&#39;t overweight. Crazy how that works! I&#39;m still trying to get used to buying clothes in mediums and smalls instead of 2XLs. It&#39;s a big adjustment because I still find myself buying clothes too big for me. But I&#39;m now in a size 6 and 4 in jeans!</p>\n\n<p>Only downside I have noticed is more hair loss than usual. Luckily I have a lot of hair to begin with so it isn&#39;t noticeable. I&#39;m next goal after I hit 135 or 130 is to start building on muscle and getting my butt back at least since that was the first thing to go on my weight loss! It&#39;s amazing how well zepbound works! I also changed my eating habits and have been a lot more active which I think helped me lose so much so fast!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

Here is what I think of Mounjaro. \n\n• I had the worst sleep apnea known to man, within two weeks of Mounjaro I was sleeping like a baby thru the whole night\n•I think it’s fair to say that Mounjaro probably helped me with about 15 % of the weight loss. \n\n• for myself I wanted to take it slow, so I’m at 5mg for 3 months, first 3 months 2.5mg, I have no intentions of moving up.   So the bullet point is this stuff is very powerful and taking it slow is \n\n• I won’t drink or eat bad food or combine food because if I do, I will get severally sick.  You need to be very careful of what you eat and also combining foods like dairy like ice cream with meat / Pork\n\n• it definitely has had both positive and negative on the mental side.   The suppression, the motivation, and energy is all good, but it does make me get a little over the top with emotions sometimes and I have to manage it \n\n• The saying, “ once you prioritize yourself, you are going to make a lot of ppl man “ is so true.   Ppl hate that you are successful and many judge you.    It’s like they rather see you dying before their eyes, instead of you living a long healthy life.   Lost my best friend because he was jealous, hating on me, and making fun of me behind my back.   So in reality I lost 389 pounds because I lost him and his toxicity out of my life.   Over 20 years of me backing him and being a good friend and choosing him over other ppl when he was at his lowest.   \n\n•  it’s not easy, there is no quick fix and if you don’t put in the work, don’t expect results \n\n• I will only weigh myself once a month or at a doctor visit.   Weighing yourself everyday works for many, for me, it has discouraged me and made me go back to old habits because I didn’t like the results I saw.\n\n• Finally I found friends and good ppl who have experienced the same thru this forum and TikTok.  Social media has been a tool I have used for motivation.\n\nThe last picture is me today.  The others were from my darkest days.   Scroll to end to see me, the new me.   ",

A1C 11</p>\n\n<p>Today is June 21st and I weigh 220.   Here is what I think of Mounjaro. </p>\n\n<p>• I had the worst sleep apnea known to man, within two weeks of Mounjaro I was sleeping like a baby thru the whole night\n•I think it’s fair to say that Mounjaro probably helped me with about 15 % of the weight loss. </p>\n\n<p>• for myself I wanted to take it slow, so I’m at 5mg for 3 months, first 3 months 2.5mg, I have no intentions of moving up.   So the bullet point is this stuff is very powerful and taking it slow is </p>\n\n<p>• I won’t drink or eat bad food or combine food because if I do, I will get severally sick.  You need to be very careful of what you eat and also combining foods like dairy like ice cream with meat / Pork</p>\n\n<p>• it definitely has had both positive and negative on the mental side.   The suppression, the motivation, and energy is all good, but it does make me get a little over the top with emotions sometimes and I have to manage it </p>\n\n<p>• The saying, “ once you prioritize yourself, you are going to make a lot of ppl man “ is so true.   Ppl hate that you are successful and many judge you.    It’s like they rather see you dying before their eyes, instead of you living a long healthy life.   Lost my best friend because he was jealous, hating on me, and making fun of me behind my back.   So in reality I lost 389 pounds because I lost him and his toxicity out of my life.   Over 20 years of me backing him and being a good friend and choosing him over other ppl when he was at his lowest.   </p>\n\n<p>•  it’s not easy, there is no quick fix and if you don’t put in the work, don’t expect results </p>\n\n<p>• I will only weigh myself once a month or at a doctor visit.   Weighing yourself everyday works for many, for me, it has discouraged me and made me go back to old habits because I didn’t like the results I saw.</p>\n\n<p>• Finally I found friends and good ppl who have experienced the same thru this forum and TikTok.  Social media has been a tool I have used for motivation.</p>\n\n<p>The last picture is me today.  The others were from my darkest days.   Scroll to end to see me, the new me.   </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

Most of the fluid had come off my body by then. \n\nNow I’m at 460, which sounds unbelievably terrible to many of you, I know, but it’s over 100 pounds down, and still going. ANYway… \n\nI’m finally noticing that I look really different. Even from when I started the semaglutide. I mean I’ve been able to tell in my face for a long time that I look super different from when I went into the hospital.\n\nBut you know what? Losing a hundred pounds makes your body look different! 🤣 I can finally really see the difference. It only took losing 100 pounds for it to be visible to me! (Caveat: I could live without the droopiness, but you can’t have everything, I suppose.)\n\nBut seriously, I’ve gone from looking like a blown-up water balloon with eyes to just a fat person. I look like a large-fat person and that is a huge win for me. Being able to buy things from Torrid. Knees that hurt MUCH less than they did. Being able to work out in the water for forty-five minutes at a stretch. \n\nThese are all wins. But the one I’m feeling right now is the “hello, there, sweetheart,” of re-encountering my body. If I make it into the 300’s, which I hope to do this year, I don’t know what I’ll do. Cry, for sure.\n\nPs-I look damn cute in my new jeans—and I can TELL.\n\n",

I take three pics each week to try and document things. I’ve seen a lot of improvement in strength, stamina and flexibility. My waist size has gone from 58 to 46 and I’ve needed a new wardrobe. Healthwise, I’ve been able to stop high BP medicine and my A1C, etc. went from the Hugh end of normal to the low end, so my doctor is pleased. </p>\n\n<p>Truly I don’t see a major difference in my before/after pictures. But I truly think we lose weight at such a rapid clip that our brains - at least my brain - doesn’t quite recognize the change. I’ve had a bit of a stall at 7.5, so I just went up to 10mg. I’ve got about 35 pounds until my first goal - any time I get below 250, I basically stop getting aches and pains related to lumbar fusion I had 20 years ago. </p>\n\n<p>I’ve appreciated the advice and support from this community from day 1, so I wanted to share my experience with you guys as I hit a year!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

I have other things to think about with summer coming. I do weigh every day out of habit and this morning I weighed 139.1. Assumed it was just a scale glitch. They occasionally happen although it’s usually ten lbs when it does! Stepped again, same. Moved the scale to a different area to adjust for tilting just in case. Same! Got on my other scale (don’t judge me) and it was the same. So folks after 13 months on MJ I am officially down smaller than before I got pregnant with my daughter when I was 19 yo!! My daughter is almost 36. \nI’m amazed and shocked. \nI haven’t taken new photos in awhile but here’s reference for those who are new </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

I saw and was like nah this isn’t going to fit my stomach is going to bulge out. Tried it on and I actually started crying. The weight loss has been slow but that was fine for me. Started mounjaro October 2023. It’s just amazing to see and feel good. To everyone on this journey you can do it! Be happy with one pound at a time. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

    "body": "5’7, SW: 244.5lbs CW: 161.7lbs. 11 months later. I did it. My ex saw me the other day and didn’t recognise me (literally) lol it was very surreal. Funny how I kindve started this journey cause of I was in a low place partly because of him and when I got that reaction of shock and him telling me how beautiful I looked it didn’t make me feel good. It didn’t hit how I thought it would hit. Losing weight ironically made me realise how little your looks have to do with how you feel inside. \n\nI think I took my last shot around a month ago. I have gallstones from losing weight (please be careful during this journey it’s quite common) so I still have trouble eating so I think I’m still losing weight but I don’t want to lose anymore. I want to gain muscle back. My appetite has also started to return which is nice and when I get my gallbladder out I will finally be able to eat properly and enjoy food again! \n\nPlease see my other posts if you’re interested in my journey. Good luck everyone and goodbye ♥️ it’s been a pleasure. Thank you Mounjaro 🙏🏽",

My ex saw me the other day and didn’t recognise me (literally) lol it was very surreal. Funny how I kindve started this journey cause of I was in a low place partly because of him and when I got that reaction of shock and him telling me how beautiful I looked it didn’t make me feel good. It didn’t hit how I thought it would hit. Losing weight ironically made me realise how little your looks have to do with how you feel inside. </p>\n\n<p>I think I took my last shot around a month ago. I have gallstones from losing weight (please be careful during this journey it’s quite common) so I still have trouble eating so I think I’m still losing weight but I don’t want to lose anymore. I want to gain muscle back. My appetite has also started to return which is nice and when I get my gallbladder out I will finally be able to eat properly and enjoy food again! </p>\n\n<p>Please see my other posts if you’re interested in my journey. Good luck everyone and goodbye ♥️ it’s been a pleasure. Thank you Mounjaro 🙏🏽</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

So I have been back on 7.5 for two weeks, after the first week it started hitting again, food noise is gone 90%, and I’ve lost 7lbs…I talked about my plan to do this on here not too long ago and almost everyone commented that there was no way that going down in mgs (down dosing) would work if you’re already at the highest. I got some pretty nasty comments.. anyway, it’s working so if anyone is in the same boat, try down dosing! 💜</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

Don't let yourself get discouraged if you've been on one for a while! In the space of time between these pictures are plateaus. The changes seemed to happen overnight.

Full blown diabetes, felt like crap all the time. This medicine has been a godsend. A1c as of last week was 5.2, and I feel the best I&#39;ve felt in 20 years. </p>\n\n<p>I write this as a friendly reminder that plateaus \nhappen, and they happen often. Don&#39;t let yourself get discouraged if you&#39;ve been on one for a while! In the space of time between these pictures are plateaus. The changes seemed to happen overnight. The biggest of which (to me) happened between March and June. Ive been STUCK at 151/152 for a couple MONTHS, and the June pictures are from this morning.</p>\n\n<p>Just keep pushing forward, we all got this!!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

Even served in the military. \n\nAfter my first baby, I couldn’t lose weight for the life of me. Tried EVERYTHING. Keto worked in the short term but was unsustainable for me. Tried Ozempic, and went from 210 (photo on the left) to about 175. My doctor said I was insulin resistant and that’s why the glp-1 course worked well for me.\nAnnnnd I got pregnant again with baby #2. In comes MOUNJARO/ TIRZ.\n\nWeighing in at 220lb- I began my journey. I didn’t actually lose noticeable weight for about 3 months. And then it started to just fall off of me. I DO workout a few times a week and drink water. Now- 8 months later and I am about 20 lbs from my goal weight.

I actually weight a little less there than my starting weight. </p>\n\n<p>I was not a heavy person my entire life- sports were my life, I played volleyball in school, then even got into body building/ personal training. Even served in the military. </p>\n\n<p>After my first baby, I couldn’t lose weight for the life of me. Tried EVERYTHING. Keto worked in the short term but was unsustainable for me. Tried Ozempic, and went from 210 (photo on the left) to about 175. My doctor said I was insulin resistant and that’s why the glp-1 course worked well for me.\nAnnnnd I got pregnant again with baby #2. In comes MOUNJARO/ TIRZ.</p>\n\n<p>Weighing in at 220lb- I began my journey. I didn’t actually lose noticeable weight for about 3 months. And then it started to just fall off of me. I DO workout a few times a week and drink water. Now- 8 months later and I am about 20 lbs from my goal weight. Feeling better, feeling healthy, and I am no longer embarrassed when a photo is being taken. I am retaking back my life and my confidence 💕 </p>\n\n<p>Adding in my socials if anyone is interested! \nTikTok: @KatyDoesAlot </p>\n\n<p>Sw: 220\nCW: 160\nGW: 140</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

    "body": "Hello everyone, it’s been a while since I’ve posted here. As of today I have been on Mounjaro for a year and I have officially lost 100.2lbs. I started out at 253lbs two years ago and I am now at 152.8lbs as of today. Just typing all of that out feels surreal. I honestly never thought that I would be able to reach this amazing milestone and I couldn’t be more proud of myself. I have been working so hard to get to this point in my life and I wouldn’t trade this experience for anything else in the world. I want to let my success story be a symbol of hope and to help motivate others. Thank you all for tagging along with me on my journey and I wish you all the best in your own journeys!! We can do this!! Much love to you all ❤️🥰😘",

Just typing all of that out feels surreal. I honestly never thought that I would be able to reach this amazing milestone and I couldn’t be more proud of myself.

    "body": "SW: 324 CW: 218 no currently goal weight\n\nOn my 6 month anniversary of starting Mounjaro, I am happy to say that I have lost 106 pounds. I started at 324 pounds and this morning I weighed in at 218 pounds. I am a type 2 diabetic and my doctor and I wanted to try \"traditional\" diets and exercise before we made a move to Mounjaro. We tried multiple diets and workouts but there was nothing that was working to get the pounds to come off. As you can see I have had great results with Mounjaro and I am wondering why I did not try it sooner. I followed my doctors advise and moved up every month. I only stayed at 12mg for 2 months and I am currently at 15mg. I will see the doctor soon and we will come up with the next plan of action.\n\nI work on a construction site so I am walking 10,000 to 15,000 steps per day. I do weight training 3 days per week, and I do cardio every day. Cardio is a 13% incline at a speed of 3 for 30 minutes. My \"cheat code\" is to bring my iPad and catch up on my shows while I am on the treadmill, and many times I go longer than 30 minutes because I am caught up in the show.\nFor food, I monitor it with My fitness pal and I practice intermittent fasting. I try my best to eat my protein but I don't mind using shakes to reach my daily protein intake.\n\nThere were times where I thought that I was stalled, but my wife kept telling me that I was getting smaller. I was so focused on what the scale was telling me that I was not paying attention that I went from a 3XL to a large in my shirts and my waist went from a 46 to a 36. My advise would be not too focused on your weight and look at other areas.\n\nI believe in you and I know that you can do it too.",

I started at 324 pounds and this morning I weighed in at 218 pounds. I am a type 2 diabetic and my doctor and I wanted to try &quot;traditional&quot; diets and exercise before we made a move to Mounjaro. We tried multiple diets and workouts but there was nothing that was working to get the pounds to come off. As you can see I have had great results with Mounjaro and I am wondering why I did not try it sooner. I followed my doctors advise and moved up every month. I only stayed at 12mg for 2 months and I am currently at 15mg. I will see the doctor soon and we will come up with the next plan of action.</p>\n\n<p>I work on a construction site so I am walking 10,000 to 15,000 steps per day. I do weight training 3 days per week, and I do cardio every day. Cardio is a 13% incline at a speed of 3 for 30 minutes. My &quot;cheat code&quot; is to bring my iPad and catch up on my shows while I am on the treadmill, and many times I go longer than 30 minutes because I am caught up in the show.\nFor food, I monitor it with My fitness pal and I practice intermittent fasting. I try my best to eat my protein but I don&#39;t mind using shakes to reach my daily protein intake.</p>\n\n<p>There were times where I thought that I was stalled, but my wife kept telling me that I was getting smaller. I was so focused on what the scale was telling me that I was not paying attention that I went from a 3XL to a large in my shirts and my waist went from a 46 to a 36. My advise would be not too focused on your weight and look at other areas.</p>\n\n<p>I believe in you and I know that you can do it too.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

As of January 10th this year, I have been on Mounjaro for seven months, having started on June 10th of last year. My highest weight ever when I started my weight loss journey and receiving my T2D diagnosis two years ago was 253lbs. Today I weigh 169.4lbs. I have lost a total of 83.6lbs. It feels very bizarre typing that out and even more so reading it. I cannot begin to express how life changing this medication has been for me. I have watched myself go from barely looking at myself in the mirror to loving the face and body I see today. I used to think I was hideous but now I can truly see how beautiful I am, I just wish I had been able to see it this whole time because I have always been the beautiful person I see in the mirror each day. To say my weight loss has improved my self confidence and self esteem is the understatement of the century. I have gotten my life back all thanks to this medicine. I want to thank each and every one of you beautiful souls in this community for being such bright beacons of hope for me on this journey. If it weren’t for you all being so vulnerable and open about sharing your journeys, I don’t think I would have had as much success as I have experienced. Thank you all from the bottom of my heart for encouraging me along the way and going through this life changing experience with me. I couldn’t be prouder to be able to do so with you all! I wish you all continued success on your journeys and here is to the next chapter in our stories. Much love to you all ❤️❤️❤️",

It feels very bizarre typing that out and even more so reading it. I cannot begin to express how life changing this medication has been for me. I have watched myself go from barely looking at myself in the mirror to loving the face and body I see today. I used to think I was hideous but now I can truly see how beautiful I am, I just wish I had been able to see it this whole time because I have always been the beautiful person I see in the mirror each day. To say my weight loss has improved my self confidence and self esteem is the understatement of the century. I have gotten my life back all thanks to this medicine. I want to thank each and every one of you beautiful souls in this community for being such bright beacons of hope for me on this journey. If it weren’t for you all being so vulnerable and open about sharing your journeys, I don’t think I would have had as much success as I have experienced. Thank you all from the bottom of my heart for encouraging me along the way and going through this life changing experience with me. I couldn’t be prouder to be able to do so with you all! I wish you all continued success on your journeys and here is to the next chapter in our stories. Much love to you all ❤️❤️❤️</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
