    "body": "Well, I finally made my goal weight. Started at 326 in February 2024, got to 185 this week. Stayed on 5mg the entire time. My own personal preference to do that because I was sick of being so fat and stated focused on the long term health needs. \nI started by setting small goals. Walk up stairs instead of taking the elevator work, eating a variety of raw fruits and veggies for lunch, tracked all my calories and protein intake (1700-1950 cals, 130 grams of protein). I watched carb intake but really didn’t focus on that. \nThings I recognized is being on Zep, is I don’t care for breads, candy and empty calories hardly anymore. I’m surprised about that because I was a junky like many of us were. \nI like to exercise, weird for a person who didn’t like it for my entire life. Now I do it 2x a day between cardio and strength training. I do run now too. I’ve ran here and there, but I set another goal and enroll and run in a 5k. That’s coming up in about 3 weeks(I’m getting that participation medal). Since the weather is getting above 50 degrees. So I am training and ran 2 5k’s on my own and so far 43 minutes is a high accomplishment for me. \nNow since I made my goal, time for maintenance to stay focused, which my Dr said that staying on 5mg would be just fine for that. \nThanks everyone for your insights, positive energy and encouragement. \nStay focused ZEPPERS, because Zep is the first step for a healthy life. Use Zep as a tool, and not a crutch.",

SW: 275 CW 145 (4X to Medium)\n\nI have always felt beautiful, but I think I felt skinnier than I really was at my heaviest, and I feel fatter now at my lightest. The mental maintenance and weight-shame spirals may be most difficult part of all of this 😜  I'll be staying on 10mg every 7 to10 days for the rest of my life.  Zepbound is a great equalizer as I finally feel like I can lose weight with diet and exercise.  I understand now that my obesity was a symptom of a metabolic disorder and not the root cause itself. \n\nLike many of you, weight has been a huge source of embarrassment and guilt for my entire life. I truly internalized that I was less than as a person, because my weight was more-than. I was in Weight Watchers at 12, tried all sorts of diets, and even had gastric bypass surgery decades ago.  I went from 330 to 160, only to gain more than a hundred pounds back. Talk about shame... \n\nAt my current size, smaller than I was in high school, I can move my body in ways I never have previously. I went from getting winded bringing the laundry downstairs, to doing mini triathlons. However, the most extraordinary impact of this drug is the mental space it has afforded me. I never realized how much of my brain and energy were focused on food, because I never knew another reality existed. \n\nI picked up a lot of great (for me) habits in the past 1.5 years. I work out 3-4 times a week, I eat more protein and fewer processed foods. I hydrate more, and I keep myself accountable through daily journaling where I track my TDEE, protein, carbs, fat, sodium, sleep, water, hunger/poos, my feelings, and what I'm grateful for. \n\nMy gratitude for this drug is immense. It wasn't the drug alone that made me successful, but it has been a phenomenal partner. \n\nGood luck to everyone on your journeys.

Sunday is my off day (sometimes I still take walks). I make protein my priority, eat my veggies after my protein, and my carbs last (so I&#39;m full off protein and veggies).

The last 10 to 15 pounds have been really stubborn, but I'm happy to report that, as of the beginning of February, I have achieved my goal weight and entered ONEderland!!\n\nFor those who wonder... It's been a balance of diet (high protein, low calories, high fiber, low fat) and exercise. I've been going to Planet Fitness for 4 to 6 days per week since I started my journey, and my workouts consist of a mixture of strength training and fat burning/cardio. More recently, I've been doing more serious lifting (heavier weight and less reps, to build muscle mass), but I'm still doing a mile of inclined walking on the treadmill each time I go.\n\nI am 6'0\" and 42 years old,. I started on 2.5mg, then titrated up each month until I reached the max dose of 15mg. I did spend a couple of extra months on 10 and 12.5 mg before moving to 15, but I've been on 15 for three months now. I've had virtual no negative side effects, other than mild to moderate constipation in the beginning and some mild random nausea for the first 6 or 7 weeks.\n\nI'm very happy with my weight loss,  but I am trying to add a little more muscle mass. I'm dealing with a good amount of lose skjn, especially around the bottom of my stomach (the shorts are pulled up high to hide it in the \"after\" pic). I do feel amazing, and never thought I'd be this healthy again in my life. I'm fully committed to keeping the weight off, and will be working with my doctor to transition into \"maintenance mode\" to decrease my dosage. My ultimate goal is to get off of the medication all together abd see if I can maintain the healthier eating and exercise habits on my own, but I'm ok with staying on a small maintenance dosage for the rest of my life, if that's what it takes.\n\nThis group has been a big inspiration and support for me along my journey, and I wanted to share my story and results in hopes that it inspires or helps someone else.",

I’ve probably not been at this weight since before puberty. \n\nI’ve enjoyed most of all the peace that having no food noise brings, and allows me to learn how to nourish my body and feel its cues. The only food cue I’d ever felt before was “hungry now, eat simple carb immediately!” Now I feel like, when I am hungry, I can figure out what my body needs most and give it that, and there’s no weird anxiety or stress about it. Still means a lil treat sometimes though! I think people are surprised to learn I still eat everything I want. Just, less. \n\nI also really leaned into the power of NEAT calories, prioritizing just not being sedentary and walking regularly over high intensity cardio which I hate so much, still do. I also started lifting weights, which I’ve come to love and look forward to. I can’t believe I actually like exercise. Tbh I always just lowkey thought people who said that, were lying. \n\nNow I venture into maintaining the loss and am a little nervous! But today just celebrating!! ",

I’ve probably not been at this weight since before puberty. </p>\n\n<p>I’ve enjoyed most of all the peace that having no food noise brings, and allows me to learn how to nourish my body and feel its cues. The only food cue I’d ever felt before was “hungry now, eat simple carb immediately!” Now I feel like, when I am hungry, I can figure out what my body needs most and give it that, and there’s no weird anxiety or stress about it. Still means a lil treat sometimes though! I think people are surprised to learn I still eat everything I want. Just, less. </p>\n\n<p>I also really leaned into the power of NEAT calories, prioritizing just not being sedentary and walking regularly over high intensity cardio which I hate so much, still do. I also started lifting weights, which I’ve come to love and look forward to. I can’t believe I actually like exercise. Tbh I always just lowkey thought people who said that, were lying. </p>\n\n<p>Now I venture into maintaining the loss and am a little nervous! But today just celebrating!! </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

    "body": "It's my 1 year (+2 weeks) anniversary since I started Zepbound!! My highest weight in the first picture was around 290.. honestly I stopped weighing myself, so it's possible that I was heavier. Next is right before I started Zep a year ago after YEARS of strict dieting, exercise, and trying different weight loss meds. After 6ish years working with my doctor I was able to get down to 258 when I took the leap of faith with Zepbound on 02/27/24. I'm now -116lbs down at 142 lbs. Something I never thought would be possible again in my life. I wanted to include a clear picture of my face because I'm going to be a bit vulnerable in my post, it's my story and I want to own it.\n\nSo, if you want to read more about my journey... here we go...\n\nI've always been one of the bigger girls, overweight but not obese for much of my life. In 6th grade I was the tallest PERSON in my entire grade, already 5'8\". I spent my entire life trying to make myself 'smaller'. I was raised by a weight-obsessed mother, who saw my bigger frame as a justification to make comments about everything I ate, even though I was about 150 lbs. I was diagnosed with PCOS at 16 years old, but I still tried everything to lose weight. I was a really active teenager, I played softball and played snare drum for a championship level marching band, indoor drumline, and drum corps in the summer. I could run miles like it was nothing with my heavy drum slung on my body. But the fat shaming never stopped until I moved away from home. I had already developed a detrimental relationship with food and my self-esteem was fractured. I hated having my picture taken, masked my severe social anxiety with my wit and 'gift of gab' as people say, and felt like I was the ugly fat funny friend no matter who I was with.\n\nThen, when I was around 27 years old, I ballooned up and gained over 100lbs in about a year out of nowhere. I started having spontaneous panic attacks, my hair started falling out, and I became as reclusive as possible. Every doctor dismissed me, like I was lying about how I gained weight and there was no way I was dieting and exercising. They swore if I was being honest, I wouldn't keep gaining weight and I would lose it. But I wasn't lying and I FINALLY found someone who listened to me. He's still my primary care doctor today. He took the time to not only listen to me, but stopped at nothing until we figured out what caused this sudden change.\n\nAfter a year of tests and different specialists, I found out I have Hashimoto's disease with soy being one of my biggest food triggers. I also have IgG and IgA immunodeficiencies. Plus the PCOS, my metabolism was essentially despondent and gave up on me like I was giving up on myself. I started seeing a psychiatrist and found out I'm AuDHD, which contributed to my obsessive/complusive tendencies, perfectionism, people pleasing, and self-destructive behaviors which were amplified by not being able to explain or control what was happening. Everything was finally coming together like puzzle pieces scattered around a labyrinth that I had to solve. The time between my diagnoses and starting Zepbound, I worked really hard on developing a better relationship with food; no more starving myself and obsessing over every calorie, figuring out my autoimmune triggers, and not categorizing everything as good or 'bad'. I found fun ways to exercise that didn't leave my entire body aching every time. Most importantly, I began addressing the detrimental narratives that were leaving my psyche in a constant cycle of waste.\n\nNow here I am today, with all my vulnerability, and still feel like I am being too 'big' for my post. If you made it this far, I appreciate you. I'm definitely struggling with body dysmorphia, so I am hoping making this post and putting this all into words will help me work through some issues I am having. I'm doing really well with my weight loss, regaining my control, and focusing on my health... I should be happy, right? I feel so uncomfortable when people I know compliment me. The worst is when people say things like, 'I almost didn't recognize you' or 'You're so skinny now!\" Like my mother was right, and validation only comes from appearance. But this is all a journey, and I look forward to appreciating compliments and believing them one day.\n\nLove you all, this sub has been such amazing support for me this past year. We all have different stories to tell, but the one thing that will bond us for life is finding this life-changing medication 💜💜",

      "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>It&#39;s my 1 year (+2 weeks) anniversary since I started Zepbound!! My highest weight in the first picture was around 290.. honestly I stopped weighing myself, so it&#39;s possible that I was heavier. Next is right before I started Zep a year ago after YEARS of strict dieting, exercise, and trying different weight loss meds. After 6ish years working with my doctor I was able to get down to 258 when I took the leap of faith with Zepbound on 02/27/24. I&#39;m now -116lbs down at 142 lbs. Something I never thought would be possible again in my life. I wanted to include a clear picture of my face because I&#39;m going to be a bit vulnerable in my post, it&#39;s my story and I want to own it.</p>\n\n<p>So, if you want to read more about my journey... here we go...</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve always been one of the bigger girls, overweight but not obese for much of my life. In 6th grade I was the tallest PERSON in my entire grade, already 5&#39;8&quot;. I spent my entire life trying to make myself &#39;smaller&#39;. I was raised by a weight-obsessed mother, who saw my bigger frame as a justification to make comments about everything I ate, even though I was about 150 lbs. I was diagnosed with PCOS at 16 years old, but I still tried everything to lose weight. I was a really active teenager, I played softball and played snare drum for a championship level marching band, indoor drumline, and drum corps in the summer. I could run miles like it was nothing with my heavy drum slung on my body. But the fat shaming never stopped until I moved away from home. I had already developed a detrimental relationship with food and my self-esteem was fractured. I hated having my picture taken, masked my severe social anxiety with my wit and &#39;gift of gab&#39; as people say, and felt like I was the ugly fat funny friend no matter who I was with.</p>\n\n<p>Then, when I was around 27 years old, I ballooned up and gained over 100lbs in about a year out of nowhere. I started having spontaneous panic attacks, my hair started falling out, and I became as reclusive as possible. Every doctor dismissed me, like I was lying about how I gained weight and there was no way I was dieting and exercising. They swore if I was being honest, I wouldn&#39;t keep gaining weight and I would lose it. But I wasn&#39;t lying and I FINALLY found someone who listened to me. He&#39;s still my primary care doctor today. He took the time to not only listen to me, but stopped at nothing until we figured out what caused this sudden change.</p>\n\n<p>After a year of tests and different specialists, I found out I have Hashimoto&#39;s disease with soy being one of my biggest food triggers. I also have IgG and IgA immunodeficiencies. Plus the PCOS, my metabolism was essentially despondent and gave up on me like I was giving up on myself. I started seeing a psychiatrist and found out I&#39;m AuDHD, which contributed to my obsessive/complusive tendencies, perfectionism, people pleasing, and self-destructive behaviors which were amplified by not being able to explain or control what was happening. Everything was finally coming together like puzzle pieces scattered around a labyrinth that I had to solve. The time between my diagnoses and starting Zepbound, I worked really hard on developing a better relationship with food; no more starving myself and obsessing over every calorie, figuring out my autoimmune triggers, and not categorizing everything as good or &#39;bad&#39;. I found fun ways to exercise that didn&#39;t leave my entire body aching every time. Most importantly, I began addressing the detrimental narratives that were leaving my psyche in a constant cycle of waste.</p>\n\n<p>Now here I am today, with all my vulnerability, and still feel like I am being too &#39;big&#39; for my post. If you made it this far, I appreciate you. I&#39;m definitely struggling with body dysmorphia, so I am hoping making this post and putting this all into words will help me work through some issues I am having. I&#39;m doing really well with my weight loss, regaining my control, and focusing on my health... I should be happy, right? I feel so uncomfortable when people I know compliment me. The worst is when people say things like, &#39;I almost didn&#39;t recognize you&#39; or &#39;You&#39;re so skinny now!&quot; Like my mother was right, and validation only comes from appearance. But this is all a journey, and I look forward to appreciating compliments and believing them one day.</p>\n\n<p>Love you all, this sub has been such amazing support for me this past year. We all have different stories to tell, but the one thing that will bond us for life is finding this life-changing medication 💜💜</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

I was going for 150 but I think I will go on into maintenance at 170. So I guess 6 more pounds to go!! 😆\nI’m still rocking with 2.5mg since I started in February.

I'm next goal after I hit 135 or 130 is to start building on muscle and getting my butt back at least since that was the first thing to go on my weight loss! It's amazing how well zepbound works!

I&#39;m 5&#39;7. I never realized how big I actually was until looking at old pictures. It&#39;s crazy how I never realized I was actually fat because I thought I still looked the same as I used to when I wasn&#39;t overweight. Crazy how that works! I&#39;m still trying to get used to buying clothes in mediums and smalls instead of 2XLs. It&#39;s a big adjustment because I still find myself buying clothes too big for me. But I&#39;m now in a size 6 and 4 in jeans! </p>\n\n<p>Only downside I have noticed is more hair loss than usual. Luckily I have a lot of hair to begin with so it isn&#39;t noticeable. I&#39;m next goal after I hit 135 or 130 is to start building on muscle and getting my butt back at least since that was the first thing to go on my weight loss! It&#39;s amazing how well zepbound works! I also changed my eating habits and have been a lot more active which I think helped me lose so much so fast!  </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

    "body": "(This post ended up being pretty long. It’s a celebration, info about my journey and a rant at the end about others who invalidate our journey bc we used GLP1s) \n\nYa’ll, I’m 50 lbs from my goal!!! 😭 From 320 to 170 and my goal is 120. \n\nPlus, I’m 1 lb away from a 29.9 bmi! I started at 56.7 bmi, which I think is class 3 obesity. 29.9 puts me in overweight. 🥹 I did not think back in May 2024 when I started this journey (at first with Saxenda then changed to Zep in Aug 2024), that I’d be 150 lbs smaller in a little over a year. \n\nIf you are starting in the higher range like I did, don’t let anyone tell you that you can only lose a certain percentage with Zepbound or that your loss will slow down greatly after you reach a year in or a certain weight. I’ve been on 15 mg for 3 months. This last month, I’ve lost the most I ever have in one month, 15 lbs. I’ve lost 46.88% of my original body weight. I realize everyone is different and for some it doesn’t work or loss is slow. But don’t get discouraged if you are just starting out and have a lot to lose. \n\nAs for diet, I eat anti-inflammatory. I have lipedema and I’ve seen huge improvements on my legs from cutting out foods that inflame me. The lipedema is definitely still there along with a lot of extra skin but my legs are loose and jiggly instead of swollen, full, tight and fibrotic. I can see some definition in my quads that I’ve never seen before. But I’m gluten and dairy free (except hard aged cheese thank goodness 😂), low oxalate, low processed and low sugar, no red meat and I watch my carb intake but I’m not keto. Like I don’t replace bread and pasta with a gluten free option. I just don’t eat it regularly. But if I do have a craving, I buy gluten free pasta and cook myself a small portion. I don’t deny something I want as long as I stay gluten and dairy free. They are non negotiable. I mostly eat chicken, turkey, tuna, salmon, shrimp, scallops, squash, zucchini, broccoli, brussel sprouts, and cauliflower. \nI only drink water, mostly Aldi sparking mineral water. I get 1 Sonic diet Dr Pepper a week with sugar free cherry syrup, vanilla and lime wedges. If artificial sweeteners didn’t give me headaches, I’d have one every day. My favorite treat is frozen cotton candy grapes. But they are out of season so I’ve got to find something else after I finish my last bag. \n\nAs far as exercise, before I started my new job, I walked 3-4 miles 3 days a week. But the other days I was pretty sedentary. Now I’m getting about 10k steps everyday so even though I’m not walking those 4 miles, I’m sure it equals out bc I’m no longer sedentary with days I got under 1000 steps 😅. My lifting is still not a routine. I’d love for it to be. I just have to find a good schedule that works best between my job, family responsibilities etc. I feel like it’s the part of my life that I’m allowing excuses in right now. I’m not prioritizing lifting and my body shows it. So that’s my next move. Any advice on making exercise a routine, balancing it with life responsibilities, or even figuring out what to do is greatly appreciated. Right now, I have multiple collections on IG for different target areas and I save people’s content to the collections. That way it’s easy to refer to. \n\nMuch love to everyone on this journey, no matter if you’re just starting Zepbound or compounded tirzepatide, somewhere along the journey or you’re in maintenance. The path we’ve chosen to get healthy, lose weight, lose inflammation (whatever your goal and reason is) is just as legit and valid as someone who does it without the meds. We all have different genetic makeup. Some need GLP1s as a tool to correct issues in our bodies. Do not let people make you feel less than or guilty for using it. It’s your body. I don’t guilt trip a person with depression for taking SSRIs. Can you imagine telling them it’s easy, just meditate and journal? I don’t guilt trip a diabetic for taking insulin. I don’t guilt trip someone with ADHD for taking a stimulant. We don’t tell them to treat it naturally.  So I won’t feel guilty for taking Zepbound, greatly increasing my life expectancy and improving my quality of life! \n\nI can’t wait to update yall again when I reach my goal of 200 lbs lost. 🥰❤️ ",

The path we’ve chosen to get healthy, lose weight, lose inflammation (whatever your goal and reason is) is just as legit and valid as someone who does it without the meds. We all have different genetic makeup. Some need GLP1s as a tool to correct issues in our bodies. Do not let people make you feel less than or guilty for using it. It’s your body. I don’t guilt trip a person with depression for taking SSRIs. Can you imagine telling them it’s easy, just meditate and journal? I don’t guilt trip a diabetic for taking insulin. I don’t guilt trip someone with ADHD for taking a stimulant. We don’t tell them to treat it naturally.  So I won’t feel guilty for taking Zepbound, greatly increasing my life expectancy and improving my quality of life! \n\nI can’t wait to update yall again when I reach my goal of 200 lbs lost. 🥰❤️ ",

      "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>(This post ended up being pretty long. It’s a celebration, info about my journey and a rant at the end about others who invalidate our journey bc we used GLP1s) </p>\n\n<p>Ya’ll, I’m 50 lbs from my goal!!! 😭 From 320 to 170 and my goal is 120. </p>\n\n<p>Plus, I’m 1 lb away from a 29.9 bmi! I started at 56.7 bmi, which I think is class 3 obesity. 29.9 puts me in overweight. 🥹 I did not think back in May 2024 when I started this journey (at first with Saxenda then changed to Zep in Aug 2024), that I’d be 150 lbs smaller in a little over a year. </p>\n\n<p>If you are starting in the higher range like I did, don’t let anyone tell you that you can only lose a certain percentage with Zepbound or that your loss will slow down greatly after you reach a year in or a certain weight. I’ve been on 15 mg for 3 months. This last month, I’ve lost the most I ever have in one month, 15 lbs. I’ve lost 46.88% of my original body weight. I realize everyone is different and for some it doesn’t work or loss is slow. But don’t get discouraged if you are just starting out and have a lot to lose. </p>\n\n<p>As for diet, I eat anti-inflammatory. I have lipedema and I’ve seen huge improvements on my legs from cutting out foods that inflame me. The lipedema is definitely still there along with a lot of extra skin but my legs are loose and jiggly instead of swollen, full, tight and fibrotic. I can see some definition in my quads that I’ve never seen before. But I’m gluten and dairy free (except hard aged cheese thank goodness 😂), low oxalate, low processed and low sugar, no red meat and I watch my carb intake but I’m not keto. Like I don’t replace bread and pasta with a gluten free option. I just don’t eat it regularly. But if I do have a craving, I buy gluten free pasta and cook myself a small portion. I don’t deny something I want as long as I stay gluten and dairy free. They are non negotiable. I mostly eat chicken, turkey, tuna, salmon, shrimp, scallops, squash, zucchini, broccoli, brussel sprouts, and cauliflower. \nI only drink water, mostly Aldi sparking mineral water. I get 1 Sonic diet Dr Pepper a week with sugar free cherry syrup, vanilla and lime wedges. If artificial sweeteners didn’t give me headaches, I’d have one every day. My favorite treat is frozen cotton candy grapes. But they are out of season so I’ve got to find something else after I finish my last bag. </p>\n\n<p>As far as exercise, before I started my new job, I walked 3-4 miles 3 days a week. But the other days I was pretty sedentary. Now I’m getting about 10k steps everyday so even though I’m not walking those 4 miles, I’m sure it equals out bc I’m no longer sedentary with days I got under 1000 steps 😅. My lifting is still not a routine. I’d love for it to be. I just have to find a good schedule that works best between my job, family responsibilities etc. I feel like it’s the part of my life that I’m allowing excuses in right now. I’m not prioritizing lifting and my body shows it. So that’s my next move. Any advice on making exercise a routine, balancing it with life responsibilities, or even figuring out what to do is greatly appreciated. Right now, I have multiple collections on IG for different target areas and I save people’s content to the collections. That way it’s easy to refer to. </p>\n\n<p>Much love to everyone on this journey, no matter if you’re just starting Zepbound or compounded tirzepatide, somewhere along the journey or you’re in maintenance. The path we’ve chosen to get healthy, lose weight, lose inflammation (whatever your goal and reason is) is just as legit and valid as someone who does it without the meds.

It feels good to move and not be suffocating under my own weight the entire time. \n\nI have stretch marks and loose skin but it’s not NEARLY as bad as I was anticipating. \n\nMy weight loss journey has been pretty slow (started August 2023 - was probably over 300 lbs but didn’t start keeping track until I was 294 - then started Zep August 2024 at 234 lbs) but slow loss, weight training, moisturizing, and hydrating has helped minimize loose skin for me personally. \n\nI do also have a ton of upper arm fat that I am not thrilled about and my arms are still huge compared to the rest of me. I may look into getting a brachioplasty down the line. I do indoor bouldering and arm training a lot and it hasn’t made much of a difference so far - obviously part of the price you pay when you have a lot to loose, but something I am still self conscious about for sure. Just sharing :)\n\nI have had minimal side effects on Zep so far (currently on 12.5mg). I have about 20 lbs to go until I reach my “goal” but I’m happy with where I’m at, and the more I strength train, the more the goalpost kind of shifts 😅 I’ll keep seeing how I’m feeling!\n",

It feels good to move and not be suffocating under my own weight the entire time. </p>\n\n<p>I have stretch marks and loose skin but it’s not NEARLY as bad as I was anticipating. </p>\n\n<p>My weight loss journey has been pretty slow (started August 2023 - was probably over 300 lbs but didn’t start keeping track until I was 294 - then started Zep August 2024 at 234 lbs) but slow loss, weight training, moisturizing, and hydrating has helped minimize loose skin for me personally. </p>\n\n<p>I do also have a ton of upper arm fat that I am not thrilled about and my arms are still huge compared to the rest of me. I may look into getting a brachioplasty down the line. I do indoor bouldering and arm training a lot and it hasn’t made much of a difference so far - obviously part of the price you pay when you have a lot to loose, but something I am still self conscious about for sure. Just sharing :)</p>\n\n<p>I have had minimal side effects on Zep so far (currently on 12.5mg). I have about 20 lbs to go until I reach my “goal” but I’m happy with where I’m at, and the more I strength train, the more the goalpost kind of shifts 😅 I’ll keep seeing how I’m feeling!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

    "body": "These are a few side effects that have happened to me since losing 100+ lbs on Zepbound\n\n1. I waste gas now - I get ready for work so quickly because all my outfits look fine, so I find myself sitting in the parking lot at work with my vehicle idling waiting for my start time \n\n2.  Twisted ankle - I was walking by a window, caught my reflection and stared in disbelief so long that I tripped stepping off the curb and twisted my ankle. \n\n3. My water bill has increased- it takes way more water to fill up my bubble bath. \n\n4. Putting people out of work- I can now shovel snow, rake my yard, cut my grass, and deep clean my house by myself. Sorry to the neighborhood folks that I paid to help with these things\n\n5.  Annoying people around me with my great mood and high energy levels- my partner just wants to relax and I’m zooming around the house organizing and starting projects \n\n6.  Stink eye from certain colleagues- eat your heart out, you jealous, miserable ladies!!!!\n\n7.  I no longer get invited to “all you can eat” outings - it’s a waste of $$ because I don’t eat enough to justify the price \n\nThis was meant to be lighthearted. I’m over the moon happy with Zepbound and my progress. Feel free to comment with your own unique side effects. ❤️\n\nI didn’t expect this post to blow up the way it has. I am so happy for all of you and so hopeful for all of you who haven’t started yet. Thank you so much for all of the encouragement. I love you all. ❤️❤️❤️",

    "body": "180 something to 139! \n\nThis has truly changed my life. I have so much energy, I feel strong, I can walk up hills easily, my thighs don’t chafe in this disgusting heat. Getting dressed is no longer an exercise in mind over matter. My brain isn’t constantly thinking about food calculations. \n\nI chose my goal weight of 140 because I remember that’s what I weighed when I got married. I thought, if I can get to that weight, that would be such a miracle. Well, I just passed it and I’m also officially divorced so I am re-claiming my time and my life and it just feels so good. 🥹\n\nI’ve decided that it would feel good for me to lose another 10 pounds so my final goal is gonna be 130. I just started 12.5 mg which is what finally got me out of my 141 stall. \n\nFor reference, I am 5’2. \n\nI often see posts here with people wondering when they should titrate up so I wanted to just share my personal experience understanding that it’s what I’ve noticed for myself… usually about a month or two months into a dose. I will start hovering around a number so, moving between 141 pounds to 143 pounds and back to 141 etc. When that happens for more than a month, I know it’s time to tie trade up and the almost immediate moment that I do titrate up the weight starts falling off again.\n\nI have not counted calories as that was a main thing for me when I started since I have a history of disordered eating. I do try to get more protein in, but I’m definitely below 80 g most days. \n\nThe only side effects I experienced on doses 2.5 through 7.5 was constipation. Once I started 10 mg I started to have nausea and a reaction to drinking alcohol on days one to three after my shot. \n\nSomething that has been a lifesaver is bare bones broth packets. They have 10 g of protein in them and you just put hot water in and when I’m feeling so nauseous that I can’t eat, but I know that not eating is my issue, I can usually drink one of those and it settles me enough that I can then eat. \n\nAs far as working out, I really didn’t do anything but walk my dogs up until recently when I suddenly had an urge to start lifting weights. I’m now going to the gym 2 to 4 times a week depending on my schedule and doing weights which I’m immediately feeling the benefits of because I just feel stronger. \n\nAnyway, just sharing this moment with y’all! This community has been such a huge help and support throughout the past seven months ❤️❤️❤️\n",

I have so much energy, I feel strong, I can walk up hills easily, my thighs don’t chafe in this disgusting heat. Getting dressed is no longer an exercise in mind over matter. My brain isn’t constantly thinking about food calculations. </p>\n\n<p>I chose my goal weight of 140 because I remember that’s what I weighed when I got married. I thought, if I can get to that weight, that would be such a miracle. Well, I just passed it and I’m also officially divorced so I am re-claiming my time and my life and it just feels so good. 🥹</p>\n\n<p>I’ve decided that it would feel good for me to lose another 10 pounds so my final goal is gonna be 130. I just started 12.5 mg which is what finally got me out of my 141 stall. </p>\n\n<p>For reference, I am 5’2. </p>\n\n<p>I often see posts here with people wondering when they should titrate up so I wanted to just share my personal experience understanding that it’s what I’ve noticed for myself… usually about a month or two months into a dose. I will start hovering around a number so, moving between 141 pounds to 143 pounds and back to 141 etc. When that happens for more than a month, I know it’s time to tie trade up and the almost immediate moment that I do titrate up the weight starts falling off again.</p>\n\n<p>I have not counted calories as that was a main thing for me when I started since I have a history of disordered eating. I do try to get more protein in, but I’m definitely below 80 g most days. </p>\n\n<p>The only side effects I experienced on doses 2.5 through 7.5 was constipation. Once I started 10 mg I started to have nausea and a reaction to drinking alcohol on days one to three after my shot. </p>\n\n<p>Something that has been a lifesaver is bare bones broth packets. They have 10 g of protein in them and you just put hot water in and when I’m feeling so nauseous that I can’t eat, but I know that not eating is my issue, I can usually drink one of those and it settles me enough that I can then eat. </p>\n\n<p>As far as working out, I really didn’t do anything but walk my dogs up until recently when I suddenly had an urge to start lifting weights. I’m now going to the gym 2 to 4 times a week depending on my schedule and doing weights which I’m immediately feeling the benefits of because I just feel stronger. </p>\n\n<p>Anyway, just sharing this moment with y’all! This community has been such a huge help and support throughout the past seven months ❤️❤️❤️</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

My siblings never had weight issues- we were raised the same, ate similarly, and had similar movement. Once I realized my weight was an issue, I started dieting and exercising (age 10). The weight continued to go up despite my efforts.\nI lost 60 lbs “on my own” (whatever that means) \n50 lbs in 3 years with the help of the surgery, exercising 2x every single day, and working closely with a nutritionist. In May 2024 I got on zepbound and I’ve lost 50 lbs with less exercise, less rigidity with my food, “firing” my nutritionist and just eating intuitively. </p>\n\n<p>I feel like my body is finally just working and I’m so grateful. My whole family who has witnessed my weight issues, all my work, all the blood sweat and tears are absolutely amazed at the fact that my body is just doing the damn thing with the help of zepbound. It’s truly night and day from my entire life experience. </p>\n\n<p>*pics are from my highest, 280, low 200s and now. I’m too tired to find pics from the entire journey 😂 </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

In 16 months I’ve gone from a size 16 pants that were so tight they might as well been painted on me…beyond not comfortable and tight XL shirts , but I was so embarrassed of myself to even go shopping. I was a snack cake away from full blown diabetes, I had ever growing problems with my kidneys and liver, I had asthma so bad I struggled to breathe sometimes, every joint hurt, I had horrible inflammation, I was on a high dose of combo blood pressure medication (that was barely controlling it), my skin was bad, I had zero energy, I snored so loud my husband slept in the other room, I had heart palpitations so strong that I had to to see a cardiologist…. I felt like a total failure and dreaded going out in public or seeing anyone I knew. This was not who I was, but after years of diets and working out, starving myself, and many unhealthy things, I was no better off and getting sicker by the month it felt like. The first week on this medication I knew life was about to change for the good. Every single day now I feel like a walking miracle with endless energy and no pain!! I no longer take BP meds - doctor said I no longer need them!! All bloodwork is perfect, breathing is so much better that I forget most days that I have asthma, all of the above health issues are completely gone!! Sometimes I still look at old pictures of myself then and see how sad and sick I was and am so very grateful each and every day for this medication…and this group, it has been a true source of inspiration and support for me!!",

I started this medication in March 2024. I had high hopes that I could get my health under control and would lose some weight in the process. In 16 months I’ve gone from a size 16 pants that were so tight they might as well been painted on me…beyond not comfortable and tight XL shirts , but I was so embarrassed of myself to even go shopping. I was a snack cake away from full blown diabetes, I had ever growing problems with my kidneys and liver, I had asthma so bad I struggled to breathe sometimes, every joint hurt, I had horrible inflammation, I was on a high dose of combo blood pressure medication (that was barely controlling it), my skin was bad, I had zero energy, I snored so loud my husband slept in the other room, I had heart palpitations so strong that I had to to see a cardiologist…. I felt like a total failure and dreaded going out in public or seeing anyone I knew. This was not who I was, but after years of diets and working out, starving myself, and many unhealthy things, I was no better off and getting sicker by the month it felt like. The first week on this medication I knew life was about to change for the good. Every single day now I feel like a walking miracle with endless energy and no pain!! I no longer take BP meds - doctor said I no longer need them!! All bloodwork is perfect, breathing is so much better that I forget most days that I have asthma, all of the above health issues are completely gone!! Sometimes I still look at old pictures of myself then and see how sad and sick I was and am so very grateful each and every day for this medication…and this group, it has been a true source of inspiration and support for me!!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

Dosing down starting next month! </p>\n\n<p>CRYING I DID IT!!! Zepbound and science are amazing. I’ve spent my whole life yo-yoing and dieting/exercising always to end up increasing my weight. I was at my high weight after having my daughter and going through post partum anxiety. I finally asked my doctor for weight loss medicine in spring of last year. </p>\n\n<p>I immediately felt the effects and had minimal symptoms (definitely nauseous a lot but nothing I couldn’t manage). I work out 3-5x a week. 30 mins spinning and 20-30 mins with heavy weight lifting 🏋️‍♀️ . Prioritize protein and veges. I was actually not great about water and I started getting light headed when I’d stand so have tried to correct that. </p>\n\n<p>I’ve gone from a size 18/20 to a 4/6, 3XL to a S. I definitely have loose skin on my stomach and neck areas but so worth it! I love this community and have spent so much time learning from you all ❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

Each of us comes here with a unique story — different bodies, backgrounds, traumas, and goals. Not everything about someone’s journey is visible in a single post, and assumptions can be harmful.\n\nLately, we’ve seen an uptick in judgmental comments and downvotes aimed at fellow members of this community. We want to take a moment to address this with care and clarity.\n\nMany of us have experienced shame and stigma around our weight. It’s painful and isolating. That’s why it’s especially disheartening to see similar judgment happening within our own community. Criticizing someone for not having a “high enough BMI” to start Zepbound, or questioning whether they “deserve” to be on this medication undermines the core of what this subreddit is meant to be: a place of support and understanding.\n\nIf a person has been prescribed Zepbound by their healthcare provider, that decision reflects their individual medical needs. It is not up to any of us to gatekeep who is “worthy” of being here.\n\nWe love this community — the kindness, the encouragement, the shared victories and struggles. But when users are shamed, dismissed, or downvoted for simply sharing their truth, that foundation starts to crack.\n\nIf a post isn’t for you — whether you disagree with it or just don’t connect with it — **we ask that you simply scroll past**. Not every post will resonate with everyone, and that’s okay. Respect and restraint go a long way in keeping this space safe and welcoming for all.\n\nLet’s meet each other with empathy, not judgment.

I’ve been overweight since I was 10 yo!! I’ve been on WW, and tracking before. Lost and gained more 85 lbs. \nI just couldn’t maintain it. But now with the help of a GLP – one I have been able to lose all this weight and keep it off. I’ve been stalled out for several weeks and I’m OK with that. Today is my 70th birthday.

    "title": "One Year, 130lbs Lost: A Journey of Transformation and Resilience 🎉",
    "body": "Today marks one year since I took the first step in a journey I never thought I’d have the courage to start. Just over a year ago, I was at my heaviest—350lbs—and recovering from thyroid cancer surgery that had left me gaining 30lbs in a matter of months. I felt trapped in my own body, but that all changed when I started Zepbound.\n\nThe past year has been anything but easy. Losing 130lbs isn’t just about willpower or following a routine—it’s about navigating the emotional, physical, and mental hurdles that come with change. There were days when I felt drained, nights when I doubted myself, and weeks when the side effects of the medication made me question if I could keep going. But each time I stepped on the scale and saw the progress, the joy was indescribable. Every pound lost felt like shedding a layer of pain, self-doubt, and fear. And every step forward brought me closer to the healthier, happier person I knew I could become.\n\nOne thing I’ve learned is that this journey is not about hunger management or simply losing weight—it’s about learning to live with the medication, adapting to its effects, and finding a balance that works for you. Every dose came with new challenges: hair loss during the first six months, dietary adjustments, and a strict focus on protein intake. I stuck to the same breakfast every day for an entire year. My meals are simple: high protein, low carb, and nutrient-dense. For me, this isn’t just a diet—it’s a lifestyle.\n\nIn the first three days after each injection, I fast. My daily meals are a single, well-balanced lunch packed with at least 100g of protein—sometimes even 250g. I stock up on FairLife protein drinks because no other brand works for me. I avoid sodas, alcohol, and anything that doesn’t serve my progress. Zepbound taught me something fundamental: this medication thrives on protein, and so does my journey.\n\nThe physical transformation has been incredible—new clothes every month, a closet purged of the old, and the energy to live life to its fullest. But the emotional rewards are even greater. I’ve said goodbye to medications I never thought I could live without. I’ve rediscovered confidence, resilience, and a sense of purpose. Yes, there were side effects—hair loss that required red light therapy, minoxidil, and every shampoo under the sun—but every challenge only motivated me to push harder.\n\nWhen I first found this subreddit, there were only 280 members. We were figuring things out together, sharing tips, and navigating the unknown. My doctor hadn’t even heard of Zepbound when I brought it up during an appointment. But that day, one year ago, became the start of my transformation. That was the day I chose to believe in science, to trust the process, and to fight for my health.\n\nTo anyone starting their journey: don’t fear the challenges. Embrace them. This medication isn’t a magic wand—it’s a tool, and the real art lies in how you use it. The road ahead may be tough, but the rewards are worth every struggle. Believe me when I say that the person waiting for you on the other side is someone you’ll be proud of.\n\nHere’s to all of us fighting for a healthier, brighter future. Let’s keep inspiring each other. 💪✨",

She thought I was plugging her Arbonne products in my video and said “I love this” she then came back 5 minutes later and admitted she didn’t watch it and now that she had she was “worried for me”. I told her I was confident in my doctors ability to make a decision. Fast forward to now, she asks me “so are you even eating at all?” Three times in a 5 minutes conversation. It made me feel so ashamed, and angry, but look what I’ve accomplished. I’m still 30lbs from my goal but damn…I feel good! </p>\n\n<p>SW:232 CW:149</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

    "body": "I’m an internal medicine doctor who’s worked with thousands of people on GLP-1s (and even created a GLP-1 app). A lot of the frustration I see every day could be avoided with a better understanding of what’s normal.\n\nHere are 7 things I wish more people knew:\n\n1. **Your appetite drops, but it's not magic.** Emotional or habitual eating still takes work. Exercise takes work. It may be a little easier to do the work, but it's still work.\n2. **Weight loss isn’t linear.** Expect stalls and fluctuations. You might even gain weight here and there. That doesn’t mean it’s not working. \"Weight loss\" isn't the same as \"Fat loss.\"\n3. **Set realistic, healthy expectations.** Many are disappointed in not losing at least 5 pounds per week. Anything around 1 pound per week or 1-2% body weight per week is wonderful.\n4. **Protein helps with everything.** Fullness, energy, and muscle retention all get easier when you're getting enough.\n5. **Side effects are common—and usually temporary.** Nausea, fatigue, constipation...they suck, but are often short-term.\n6. **You don’t need to be perfect.** Consistency beats perfection. The best results come from small habits and improving on them slightly week-over-week, not flipping your life upside down.\n7. **Mindset matters more than macros.** The people who win long-term break up big goals into little goals, identify ALL victories (not just on the scale), forgive themselves quickly and keep going.\n\nHappy to answer questions or expand on any of these. There’s a lot of noise out there. I want people to have real expectations and a better shot at long-term success.\n\nEdit-Post has been locked.

A lot of the frustration I see every day could be avoided with a better understanding of what’s normal.</p>\n\n<p>Here are 7 things I wish more people knew:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Your appetite drops, but it&#39;s not magic.</strong> Emotional or habitual eating still takes work. Exercise takes work. It may be a little easier to do the work, but it&#39;s still work.</li>\n<li><strong>Weight loss isn’t linear.</strong> Expect stalls and fluctuations. You might even gain weight here and there. That doesn’t mean it’s not working. &quot;Weight loss&quot; isn&#39;t the same as &quot;Fat loss.&quot;</li>\n<li><strong>Set realistic, healthy expectations.</strong> Many are disappointed in not losing at least 5 pounds per week. Anything around 1 pound per week or 1-2% body weight per week is wonderful.</li>\n<li><strong>Protein helps with everything.</strong> Fullness, energy, and muscle retention all get easier when you&#39;re getting enough.</li>\n<li><strong>Side effects are common—and usually temporary.</strong> Nausea, fatigue, constipation...they suck, but are often short-term.</li>\n<li><strong>You don’t need to be perfect.</strong> Consistency beats perfection. The best results come from small habits and improving on them slightly week-over-week, not flipping your life upside down.</li>\n<li><strong>Mindset matters more than macros.</strong> The people who win long-term break up big goals into little goals, identify ALL victories (not just on the scale), forgive themselves quickly and keep going.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Happy to answer questions or expand on any of these. There’s a lot of noise out there. I want people to have real expectations and a better shot at long-term success.</p>\n\n<p>Edit-Post has been locked. Unsure exactly why, but thank you all for reading-I hope you got some value from it!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

Am I crazy or what….</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

You all have been a great group to see support from. </p>\n\n<p>During covid, I gained nearly 100lbs thru loss of employment (I work for the airlines), loss of my partner and ultimately, loss of my unborn child. Won’t get into feel sorry for me details. Ended up binging more on booze and food and found myself in probably the darkest place in my life. I ended up in the ER over a year ago with a allergic reaction to blood pressure medicine I was on with a resting HR around 120bpm and a BP of 180/120-ish at 300lbs before I finally caved and realized I needed help. </p>\n\n<p>Spoke to my Dr about Zep and was scared to death about starting it.</p>\n\n<p>After starting in April, and then after seeing results of about a pound a day loss to start I adapted a diet of the factor meals as my appetite was curved by the zep.</p>\n\n<p>I am a military veteran and found that my self discipline never left me once I started seeing the results. As time went on I incorporated a walking exercise regime and stuck with the factor meals weekly as I found the portions were perfect for the zep.</p>\n\n<p>Barring some setbacks from a costochondritis flare up from overdoing it with exercise which is still nagging me. I have officially dropped 115lbs and my vitals have all returned to 75-80bpm HR and 120/80BP.  </p>\n\n<p>This medicine has saved my life and I hope to taper off of it and hopefully sustain my health. I’m not perfect and understand life often has a funny way of being unpredictable.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re discouraged, please keep your eye on the prize, if I can do it, anyone can. Please excuse me for covering my face as I’m shy. </p>\n\n<p>Best of luck to you all. </p>\n\n<p>Let’s GOOO!! </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

I was always told I was dirty or something thing was wrong with me by people and was very insecure .

I started zep around the same time, but because I have lived with it my whole life I never even thought about the weight loss being a “cure”. Recently I visited a new dermatologist for a different skin issue and he noticed my neck and “re” diagnosed Acanthosis nigricans. I told him I’d had it my whole life and he told me that he could do nothing about it and I just needed to lose weight and eat better. Since he didn’t have my history, he didn’t know I have already lost 60 lbs. But the realization dawned on me that I hadn’t looked at my neck in detail since the spot incident and OH MY GOD…. It’s literally almost gone. I almost cried looking at the difference, it’s still partially there, but my neck hasn’t looked this even since I was probably 6 years old. It’s insane what this drug helps to change in your life, things you’d never even think about.",

I was always told I was dirty or something thing was wrong with me by people and was very insecure . As a child I was pre diabetic, and at the same time was diagnosed with Acanthosis nigricans, which is effectively a skin condition that is affected by your blood sugar and general weight. Because I’ve become used to it and the comments I’ve gotten my whole life, I kind of stopped caring about getting rid of it. At the height of my weight though, I developed more than the normal dark lines, I got spots. My Dr said it was hormonal, but they stayed. I started zep around the same time, but because I have lived with it my whole life I never even thought about the weight loss being a “cure”. Recently I visited a new dermatologist for a different skin issue and he noticed my neck and “re” diagnosed Acanthosis nigricans. I told him I’d had it my whole life and he told me that he could do nothing about it and I just needed to lose weight and eat better. Since he didn’t have my history, he didn’t know I have already lost 60 lbs. But the realization dawned on me that I hadn’t looked at my neck in detail since the spot incident and OH MY GOD…. It’s literally almost gone. I almost cried looking at the difference, it’s still partially there, but my neck hasn’t looked this even since I was probably 6 years old.

    "body": "Hello my friends, and those who have supported me on this journey. Today marks 125lbs of weight I’ve shed. To say that everything is different now, is an understatement. \n\nThe truth is, I got heavy by comfort eating through extreme depression and anxiety. I didn’t know how to give up that vice. I had to visit that BEFORE I went for Zepbound. It’s been a roller coaster and I’ve learned a lot about myself this last year, but it’s made me much more receptive, less angry, a better communicator, and a better man. \n\nI get asked a lot of questions from new users on GLP-1s so I’m just going to share some solid advice. The number on the scale doesn’t need to matter right away. Pay attention to your body. Feeling better is the goal over everything else. I got to the point where I stopped worrying about the scale, and focused on: “How is my anxiety today? How is my clarity? Do I feel terrible? Do I feel great?”… I’ve kept a journal daily. I write short poems, my thoughts, how I’m feeling. This has been critical in my progress. \n\nI want you guys to understand the importance of hydration on this drug. It is imperative that you drink more water than you deem necessary. Zepbound tended to not make me feel thirsty early on, but I’d show dramatic symptoms of dehydration. So my biggest piece of advice is to drink, drink, drink. \n\nNext. Fiber intake, supplements, and a daily vitamin. This is good practice in general. Zepbound has a way of bringing some fatigue with it early on. A daily vitamin, and fiber to regulate you will help immensely with side effects, if any arise. \n\nAbove all. Small progression in healthy increments is better than huge progress in unhealthy leaps. You’re going to get hungry. You’re going to have bad days. You’re going to stall on the scale. You’re going to not feel great sometimes. Those are facts. Stay in control of the things you can control, and keep your momentum in the direction that makes you FEEL a difference. Progress not perfection. \n\nI love you. \n\n-C",

      "selftext": "Hello my friends, and those who have supported me on this journey. Today marks 125lbs of weight I’ve shed. To say that everything is different now, is an understatement. \n\nThe truth is, I got heavy by comfort eating through extreme depression and anxiety. I didn’t know how to give up that vice. I had to visit that BEFORE I went for Zepbound. It’s been a roller coaster and I’ve learned a lot about myself this last year, but it’s made me much more receptive, less angry, a better communicator, and a better man. \n\nI get asked a lot of questions from new users on GLP-1s so I’m just going to share some solid advice. The number on the scale doesn’t need to matter right away. Pay attention to your body. Feeling better is the goal over everything else. I got to the point where I stopped worrying about the scale, and focused on: “How is my anxiety today? How is my clarity? Do I feel terrible? Do I feel great?”… I’ve kept a journal daily. I write short poems, my thoughts, how I’m feeling. This has been critical in my progress. \n\nI want you guys to understand the importance of hydration on this drug. It is imperative that you drink more water than you deem necessary. Zepbound tended to not make me feel thirsty early on, but I’d show dramatic symptoms of dehydration. So my biggest piece of advice is to drink, drink, drink. \n\nNext. Fiber intake, supplements, and a daily vitamin. This is good practice in general. Zepbound has a way of bringing some fatigue with it early on. A daily vitamin, and fiber to regulate you will help immensely with side effects, if any arise. \n\nAbove all. Small progression in healthy increments is better than huge progress in unhealthy leaps. You’re going to get hungry. You’re going to have bad days. You’re going to stall on the scale. You’re going to not feel great sometimes. Those are facts. Stay in control of the things you can control, and keep your momentum in the direction that makes you FEEL a difference. Progress not perfection. \n\nI love you. \n\n-C",

    "body": "I started Zepbound January 1 of this year at 181lbs (I’m 5’3”). Turns out that I was a fast responder, the weight came off pretty easily, about 10lbs per month. I also implemented permanent life style changes. I cut out sugar, bread, rice, pasta, dairy, basically all processed foods. I made sure to move my body every day, I go to the gym 3 times a week to use the weight machines. I really wish I would have started weight training from the beginning.   \n\n\nCurrently I weigh 126lbs as of yesterday. My original goal was 135lbs but I (unintentionally) blew past that goal. Unfortunately I was affected by the Caremark insurance change and have been switched to Wegovy for maintenance. I have not started Wegovy yet as I still have a 2.5 mg box of Zepbound to finish. The highest dose of Zepbound I made it to was 7.5 mg (March of 2025), after 7.5 mg I requested to move my dose down. I also started skipping a week after I reached my goal weight. \n\nI hope I didn’t ramble too much, just wanted to share my experience and give motivation to keep going 😊 I faced several stalls along my journey and still made it to goal. As a 43 year old woman I thought that my best years were behind me but this medication has made me realize the best is yet to come ✨",

    "body": "36, 5’4”, 308-206. Just dropping in to share a picture comparison. At my highest back in the day I was in the 330s (2015), but where I started for this journey was at 308, and I am currently at 206, so 102 pounds lost. I started getting serious around October of 2023 with logging my food, eating in a deficit, and paying attention. I was in grad school after work that year and managed to lose/ maintain through the spring and was in the 270s at the start of the summer. Since the, I have gotten down to 206. I believe in the before picture I was probably around 290 in 2023, and the after is from this week. \n\nI have tracked my food for over 500 days at this point, although I don’t have hard limits. I just like day planners/task management and food tracking fits right in with that for me. While there is a calorie goal set, that isn’t my measurement for success. I’d say I average out about 1500-1600 calories a day. Overnight oats have become my best friend with all the goodies added. I love cooking and I’m definitely still a 3 meals a day type of person, although my portions are way more in check and snacking is irregular for me these days. I prioritize protein and fiber, I am on a strong daily vitamin habit, and I have essentially fixed my horrible IBS-D. This has been the biggest and best outcome of all the changes I have made in my life. I can immediately tell these days if I haven’t gotten the proper amount of protein and fiber, and for this gut/IBS fix alone, I am a forever convert to eating this way. I don’t restrict any of the things I have in the past, like carbs or sugar, I just practice moderation. \n\nI started Zepbound in July 2024. I had the most beautiful summer break (after also graduating myself plus being a teacher) starting my days off with dog walks, eating right, and having tons of energy to devote to our house projects. I really found myself last summer on Zep. Once the fall semester started, I decided that I was going to finish out the semester or school year and find a job that allowed me more freedom to continue to focus on myself, and I did just that. I have been wanting to make a career shift for a long time, and since finishing grad school right before Zepbound, I realized it was time. While finding a replacement and helping them get set up for success, I transitioned to a position where I contract through my state. I set my own schedule, and split my time between visiting clients and doing paperwork from home. I have never felt as alive as I do currently, and this career switch was so vital to me getting to focus on myself in a way that I’ve never managed in 15 years of education. On average, I walk our dogs about 4 miles a day and do about 3 mornings a week of what I would call gentle strength training in our basement with weights.\n\nI have reached the point in weight loss where things have started to slow down, but also changes are more quickly visible. I’m on 10 mg and plan to continue at this dose for a while. My insurance only allowed me to do a single month on 7.5, so I feel like I had to jump up a bit unwillingly. Even if we encounter insurance issues in the future, I am committed to figuring out a way to ensure I still get my Zep. I’m so excited to get under 200, and I don’t know where I will go from there. 175 has started to seem like a reasonable and maintainable goal to me, so I think that is where I am headed currently. ",

    "body": "\nI’ve lost 162.6 lbs in 16 months! 🥹 That’s 50.81% of my starting weight. I got up to 320 lbs in May 2024. I have no excuses but I will say grief, mixed with medical issues and depression can really mess up your body/mind. \n\nI cant believe I’ve now lost more than I weigh. I’ve lost 88.1” in total including 15” off my stomach, 12.2” off my waist and 15.2” off my hips. \n\nI changed my diet completely when I started Zepbound. I’m gluten and dairy free, low oxalate, low processed foods and low sugar. In Oct, I stopped eating red meat. And I drink lots of water, mostly Aldi sparkling mineral water (plain). I will have to eat this way the rest of my life because my mobility/health is negatively affected when I eat foods with gluten, dairy etc. It causes my lipedema to swell and multiply. It also causes joint pain and migraines. My body feels better without these foods so it makes me miss them way less. Just like I don’t miss brazil nuts because my throat will instantly close and I’ll die. I don’t miss gluten, dairy etc because they were just killing me slowly. \n \nI started Saxenda May 2024 and changed to Zepbound in Aug 2024. I have PCOS, insulin resistance, ADHD that causes crazy food noise without meds, and lipedema in my arms, legs and stomach. I lost coverage for Zepbound on 7/1 and became an affiliate/partner with a telehealth company to continue taking tirzepatide. I’ve been very happy with compounded and with the telehealth. I’m thankful they reached out to me right around the time I found out Caremark wanted me to switch to Wegovy which does not have an equivalent dose to 15 mg Zepbound. \n\nSince taking Tirzepatide/Zepbound, I’ve seen a reduction in cluster migraines and no longer have them weekly. The lipedema nodules have reduced in size. I see more muscle on my legs despite the lipedema than I did at this same size about 19-20 years ago, which I think is for a couple reasons. I’m more active in Florida than I ever was in GA so I’m stronger now, plus tirzepatide and eating anti-inflammatory reduces inflammation. So there’s less swelling and puffiness all over.\n\nI’m 37.4 lbs from my goal but I may find that I’m happy before that. I just don’t know until I’m there and see how I feel. Eventually I pray I can get excess skin removed but that’s a very long time from now. \n\nSorry, I wrote a book. Lots of love to all of you who have cheered me on and sent up prayers for my success in getting healthy. ❤️",

I have no excuses but I will say grief, mixed with medical issues and depression can really mess up your body/mind. </p>\n\n<p>I cant believe I’ve now lost more than I weigh. I’ve lost 88.1” in total including 15” off my stomach, 12.2” off my waist and 15.2” off my hips. </p>\n\n<p>I changed my diet completely when I started Zepbound. I’m gluten and dairy free, low oxalate, low processed foods and low sugar. In Oct, I stopped eating red meat. And I drink lots of water, mostly Aldi sparkling mineral water (plain). I will have to eat this way the rest of my life because my mobility/health is negatively affected when I eat foods with gluten, dairy etc. It causes my lipedema to swell and multiply. It also causes joint pain and migraines. My body feels better without these foods so it makes me miss them way less. Just like I don’t miss brazil nuts because my throat will instantly close and I’ll die. I don’t miss gluten, dairy etc because they were just killing me slowly. </p>\n\n<p>I started Saxenda May 2024 and changed to Zepbound in Aug 2024. I have PCOS, insulin resistance, ADHD that causes crazy food noise without meds, and lipedema in my arms, legs and stomach. I lost coverage for Zepbound on 7/1 and became an affiliate/partner with a telehealth company to continue taking tirzepatide. I’ve been very happy with compounded and with the telehealth. I’m thankful they reached out to me right around the time I found out Caremark wanted me to switch to Wegovy which does not have an equivalent dose to 15 mg Zepbound. </p>\n\n<p>Since taking Tirzepatide/Zepbound, I’ve seen a reduction in cluster migraines and no longer have them weekly. The lipedema nodules have reduced in size. I see more muscle on my legs despite the lipedema than I did at this same size about 19-20 years ago, which I think is for a couple reasons. I’m more active in Florida than I ever was in GA so I’m stronger now, plus tirzepatide and eating anti-inflammatory reduces inflammation. So there’s less swelling and puffiness all over.</p>\n\n<p>I’m 37.4 lbs from my goal but I may find that I’m happy before that. I just don’t know until I’m there and see how I feel. Eventually I pray I can get excess skin removed but that’s a very long time from now. </p>\n\n<p>Sorry, I wrote a book. Lots of love to all of you who have cheered me on and sent up prayers for my success in getting healthy. ❤️</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
