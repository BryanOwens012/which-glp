    "body": "Hi everyone,\n\nThis is a post I seriously never thought I’d make when I started on this medication. May 5th, 2023 I took my first dose of this medication and finally felt ready to change my life. I had just celebrated my 28th birthday and I had no self esteem, felt old, looked older than I was, drank too much, and didn’t know where my life was going. I started at 261.3 lbs and I just wanted to be below 200 for the first time in 7 years because I couldn’t even imagine hitting that number. The first 6-7 months were pretty miserable with side effects and my doctor and I were doing the best to manage, but I was steady losing and didn’t want to give up. Then just over a year on the medicine and i hit my goal of under 200. Then I set my next goal to 165, hit that and went to 150 thinking I’d be amazed if I ever hit it. I’m proud to say that exactly 2 years later I am 30 years old 5’5 and weigh in at 133.7 lbs! I’m 3.7 lbs from my final goal 😭 this is so emotional for me as I never thought I’d get my life back. I have confidence, a great job, I’m dating again, I’ve started running, and just feel incredible waking up every day (mostly 😉). I mean it when I say that if I can do it, so can you! It wasn’t an easy or quick journey, but semaglutide has changed my life for the better. If anyone has questions I’ll do my best to answer, but I’m not a professional and I do not have any medical advice to give. \n\nKeep going everyone and be proud of yourself at whatever stage of this journey you’re on!",

I know not everyone experiences this, but the weight just melted off with little effort for the first 9 months or so. Then, I got very sick with what we now assume was an ulcer. \nI have no idea if the ulcer is in anyway related to the medication.\nAnyway, I eventually stopped vomiting every day and was able to resume the semaglutide and continued losing weight. \nI have noticed that I still get a little nauseated if I haven't eaten enough.\nI am 213 pounds down from my heaviest weight with 170 lost while taking the medicine.\nI've also tracked my food with weight watchers just to make sure I wasn't going crazy with very caloric foods. \nI'm now in maintenance which is a little nerve wracking, but you can't just lose weight forever. I've already gotten many \"you're too thin comments.\" (I am not.) I've no ass, deflated boobs, and never have had much of a waistline.

    "body": "I started my Journey with Semiglutide in mid October of last year. At my heaviest (Pic on the right) in July of 2024 I was 417.4 lbs. I went on a \"diet\" and managed to lose 25lbs on my own, but soon realized the weight was creeping back up and I needed help. I was a fast responder to the med. I also miraculously managed to go 11 weeks without any major GI symptoms other than constipation. Then on Christmas morning I was miserable. Vomiting, diarrhea, cramping... It was awful! Couldn't even watch my kids open presents. Went to the hospital and was diagnosed with Cholecystitis. I got my gallbladder taken out. I was off the Semiglutide for almost two weeks before starting back and GI symptoms seemed to intensify and come seemingly out of nowhere on a daily basis. At first I thought it was just my body adjusting to having no gallbladder, but nothing seemed to make it any better. I would get Sulphur burps and explosive diarrhea almost daily. Was this my new normal \n\nThis went on until a couple weeks ago when I decided to really take the advice of many in this group and eat smaller, more frequent meals and eat much slower. Since that change, my Gi symptoms have all but dissappeared and the weight is continuing to go down, albeit a little slower now.\n\nStarting Weight 417.4, current weight 295.4, down 122lbs total, 97lbs since starting Sema, dose 1.5mg (been on that dose now for two months) Goal weight is 250.

I stopped focusing on weighting myself multiple times a day, I stopped obsessing over everything I ate. I just took it a day at a time. The hard struggle with my weight was my inability to not binge eat. This medication was an absolute life changer. I have always been into fitness so that was never the issue. It was the eating. But now that I don’t have constant food noise I’m able to make better choices. I still have about 80 more pounds until I’m at my goal but I honestly don’t care about a number anymore. I feel better and that is most important. Just going to continue doing this day after day and the weight loss will continue. Happy I made this change for myself. My future self will thank me as well. \n\nHW: 337 lbs\nCW: 239 lbs\nGW: around 160-189 lbs ",

I stopped focusing on weighting myself multiple times a day, I stopped obsessing over everything I ate. I just took it a day at a time. The hard struggle with my weight was my inability to not binge eat. This medication was an absolute life changer. I have always been into fitness so that was never the issue. It was the eating. But now that I don’t have constant food noise I’m able to make better choices. I still have about 80 more pounds until I’m at my goal but I honestly don’t care about a number anymore. I feel better and that is most important. Just going to continue doing this day after day and the weight loss will continue. Happy I made this change for myself. My future self will thank me as well. </p>\n\n<p>HW: 337 lbs\nCW: 239 lbs\nGW: around 160-189 lbs </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

So much amazing progress on this sub and different body types/start points, but slow losers can feel like it isn't working so please don't quit! \n\nAlso shamelessly really pleased with myself and outside of my partner and best friend no one knows I'm on wegovy! I also don't discuss weight publicly for personal reasons and because I believe all bodies deserve acceptance regardless of size. Hence showing off here 💕\n\nI lost 53lbs in total but it took 1 year and 10 months at a rate of 0.5lbs a week. I have gone from a dress size 16 UK to between 12 and 10 (US 12 to US 6)\n\nStats - Female white british 34 years old 5ft 11.5\"\nStart weight: 216lbs BMI 30 Jan 2022\nCurrently: 163lbs BMI 22.7 \nMy goal weight was 157lbs but I am happy here.\n\nI buy wegovy privately in the UK, and I didn't diet. Now the food noise is gone I try to eat intuitively. I love the Japanese eating principle Hara hachi bun me (腹八分目) and try to emulate it by stopping eating when I am no longer hungry rather than full. Stop at the first sigh is my mantra. I still eat junk food occasionally and not super strict with my diet as I want this to be my lifestyle forever. \nI've tried every diet going and I can’t maintain any weight loss.\n\nI exercise 1-3x per week weight training and I golf at weekends, although I have a very sedentary job.\n\nI had minimal side effects but I've been on it so long now. Maybe the first 3 months I had some nausea and stomach issues but I am also trying to heal gastritis and have post gallbladder removal issues (gallbladder came out in 2020 and was pre wegovy) so its hard to tell who is responsible! \n\nIf you are also a slow loser or at the beginning of your journey, then I hope this helps and have patience! Its taken nearly 2 years to get here.",

So much amazing progress on this sub and different body types/start points, but slow losers can feel like it isn&#39;t working so please don&#39;t quit! </p>\n\n<p>Also shamelessly really pleased with myself and outside of my partner and best friend no one knows I&#39;m on wegovy! I also don&#39;t discuss weight publicly for personal reasons and because I believe all bodies deserve acceptance regardless of size. Hence showing off here 💕</p>\n\n<p>I lost 53lbs in total but it took 1 year and 10 months at a rate of 0.5lbs a week. I have gone from a dress size 16 UK to between 12 and 10 (US 12 to US 6)</p>\n\n<p>Stats - Female white british 34 years old 5ft 11.5&quot;\nStart weight: 216lbs BMI 30 Jan 2022\nCurrently: 163lbs BMI 22.7 \nMy goal weight was 157lbs but I am happy here.</p>\n\n<p>I buy wegovy privately in the UK, and I didn&#39;t diet. Now the food noise is gone I try to eat intuitively. I love the Japanese eating principle Hara hachi bun me (腹八分目) and try to emulate it by stopping eating when I am no longer hungry rather than full. Stop at the first sigh is my mantra. I still eat junk food occasionally and not super strict with my diet as I want this to be my lifestyle forever. \nI&#39;ve tried every diet going and I can’t maintain any weight loss.</p>\n\n<p>I exercise 1-3x per week weight training and I golf at weekends, although I have a very sedentary job.</p>\n\n<p>I had minimal side effects but I&#39;ve been on it so long now. Maybe the first 3 months I had some nausea and stomach issues but I am also trying to heal gastritis and have post gallbladder removal issues (gallbladder came out in 2020 and was pre wegovy) so its hard to tell who is responsible! </p>\n\n<p>If you are also a slow loser or at the beginning of your journey, then I hope this helps and have patience! Its taken nearly 2 years to get here.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

Like. \"You're wasting away\" is something I hear daily. \n\nThing is, I'm just a healthier weight and they have only known me when I was heavy and that's it. \n\nOne person asked me how much I have left to lose. I remarked that I'm not sure, that I will see how I feel as I go. I don't have the same body I did when I was thinner as I've had three kids and I'm older, so I don't know what my \"goal weight\" really is. I set it at 155 (I'm 180 now) so there is still a bit to go. They were like, \"OMG you will disappear!\" \n\nOverreacting much? Jesus. I had to explain that I have two autoimmune diseases and I can't have weight on my joints if I want to save them. Like, I'm getting healthy and now I'm being told it's too much. \n\nLike, what do you know about my health struggles? Oh, and when I explain that I've had pretty crappy side effects, like the nausea and vomiting sometimes, people then are like \"whoa, that's extreme! You will develop an eating disorder!\" Like, bi*ch why you do think I'm doing this in the first place?!\n\nI just hit the \"overweight\" bmi and I am so proud of myself. And while these people are proud of me too and I know they mean well, it's starting to grate on my nerves. \n\nJust keeping ignoring it and keep moving. It's all I can do. I kind of like telling them about my joint damage and that I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis at 17 and now I have to save my joints, because then they feel bad and shut up. Thank god I'm done with the holiday parties, because as excited as I was to dress up and FEEL good, the attention on my body \"wasting away\" has been too much. \n\nLuckily I have a great support system. So cheers to the good ones and cheers to all of you for \"wasting away\". \n\n2025 is our year!!!🥂\n\nStats: 47 y/o suburban mom. \nSW: 223 \nCW: 180\nGW: 155ish?\nH: 5'4\n\nPhotos for reference.  ",

Like. &quot;You&#39;re wasting away&quot; is something I hear daily. </p>\n\n<p>Thing is, I&#39;m just a healthier weight and they have only known me when I was heavy and that&#39;s it. </p>\n\n<p>One person asked me how much I have left to lose. I remarked that I&#39;m not sure, that I will see how I feel as I go. I don&#39;t have the same body I did when I was thinner as I&#39;ve had three kids and I&#39;m older, so I don&#39;t know what my &quot;goal weight&quot; really is. I set it at 155 (I&#39;m 180 now) so there is still a bit to go. They were like, &quot;OMG you will disappear!&quot; </p>\n\n<p>Overreacting much? Jesus. I had to explain that I have two autoimmune diseases and I can&#39;t have weight on my joints if I want to save them. Like, I&#39;m getting healthy and now I&#39;m being told it&#39;s too much. </p>\n\n<p>Like, what do you know about my health struggles? Oh, and when I explain that I&#39;ve had pretty crappy side effects, like the nausea and vomiting sometimes, people then are like &quot;whoa, that&#39;s extreme! You will develop an eating disorder!&quot; Like, bi*ch why you do think I&#39;m doing this in the first place?!</p>\n\n<p>I just hit the &quot;overweight&quot; bmi and I am so proud of myself. And while these people are proud of me too and I know they mean well, it&#39;s starting to grate on my nerves. </p>\n\n<p>Just keeping ignoring it and keep moving. It&#39;s all I can do. I kind of like telling them about my joint damage and that I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis at 17 and now I have to save my joints, because then they feel bad and shut up. Thank god I&#39;m done with the holiday parties, because as excited as I was to dress up and FEEL good, the attention on my body &quot;wasting away&quot; has been too much. </p>\n\n<p>Luckily I have a great support system. So cheers to the good ones and cheers to all of you for &quot;wasting away&quot;. </p>\n\n<p>2025 is our year!!!🥂</p>\n\n<p>Stats: 47 y/o suburban mom. \nSW: 223 \nCW: 180\nGW: 155ish?\nH: 5&#39;4</p>\n\n<p>Photos for reference.  </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

Wegovy has been a complete game changer!!!\n\nStarted by seeing a nutritionist last year. Jan 12, 2025 started 0.25mg wegovy with immediate results. Feb 2025 upped to 0.5mg wegovy. Mar 2025 went up to 1mg wegovy, and still on this dose although the food noise is starting to come back. Doc says to maintain with 1mg for a bit and then start weening myself off. \n\nMy progress is 100% due to diet; I made no exercise changes. Once I got to 1mg I started getting sick from anything unhealthy. I was also very tired so I couldn’t bring myself to exercise much. Now the nausea and exhaustion are gone and I find my stomach, arms and legs have some loose skin, so I’m switching my focus to exercise. \n\nInteresting things I noticed during this process:\n- Mothers were the first to notice changes! My grandma noticed when I was only 7 lbs down. Moms I work with commented at 15 lbs down. Men didn’t comment until I was 40 lbs down, and it was men who also struggle with their weight first, then the fitness bros that were proud of me.\n- Growing up, all the early 2000s movies had skinny girls that thought they were fat. As a result, they always told us not to weigh ourselves every day, that we’ll develop an eating disorder and end up in the hospital. But this was the opposite advice of what I needed…I realized I always think I look great and the same even as I’m gaining too much weight for my frame. I guess I have the opposite of body dysmorphia? And I mentally explain away increasing sizes, blaming style changes or needing more room for my boobs. So I learned I need to weigh myself daily so I can peg myself to reality. Does anyone else feel like this??\n- My feet went down a half size, and I had to shorten my necklace and watch chains. Didn’t expect that!\n- It’s so much easier to shop now. It makes me sad that clothing companies don’t make bigger size clothing in the flattering fits for curvy girls. Everyone should be able to buy clothes that fit right. The exception is bras, they’re actually harder to find in my new size! \n- Wegovy isn’t cheap, but buying a whole new wardrobe was more expensive!!! Don’t skip including this in your budget",

Wegovy has been a complete game changer!!!</p>\n\n<p>Started by seeing a nutritionist last year. Jan 12, 2025 started 0.25mg wegovy with immediate results. Feb 2025 upped to 0.5mg wegovy. Mar 2025 went up to 1mg wegovy, and still on this dose although the food noise is starting to come back. Doc says to maintain with 1mg for a bit and then start weening myself off. </p>\n\n<p>My progress is 100% due to diet; I made no exercise changes. Once I got to 1mg I started getting sick from anything unhealthy. I was also very tired so I couldn’t bring myself to exercise much. Now the nausea and exhaustion are gone and I find my stomach, arms and legs have some loose skin, so I’m switching my focus to exercise. </p>\n\n<p>Interesting things I noticed during this process:\n- Mothers were the first to notice changes! My grandma noticed when I was only 7 lbs down. Moms I work with commented at 15 lbs down. Men didn’t comment until I was 40 lbs down, and it was men who also struggle with their weight first, then the fitness bros that were proud of me.\n- Growing up, all the early 2000s movies had skinny girls that thought they were fat. As a result, they always told us not to weigh ourselves every day, that we’ll develop an eating disorder and end up in the hospital. But this was the opposite advice of what I needed…I realized I always think I look great and the same even as I’m gaining too much weight for my frame. I guess I have the opposite of body dysmorphia? And I mentally explain away increasing sizes, blaming style changes or needing more room for my boobs. So I learned I need to weigh myself daily so I can peg myself to reality. Does anyone else feel like this??\n- My feet went down a half size, and I had to shorten my necklace and watch chains. Didn’t expect that!\n- It’s so much easier to shop now. It makes me sad that clothing companies don’t make bigger size clothing in the flattering fits for curvy girls. Everyone should be able to buy clothes that fit right. The exception is bras, they’re actually harder to find in my new size! \n- Wegovy isn’t cheap, but buying a whole new wardrobe was more expensive!!! Don’t skip including this in your budget</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

I am 2 years post skin removal surgery at this point (extended abdominal plasty, breast reduction and lift) and I am about 5-10 pounds less than when I had that surgery.\n\nI still take this medication every week (although I have switched to Zepbound in the last 6 months) and plan to continue this medication for the rest of my life. I see a lot of people posting on here about starting their journey and it can be a little discouraging, especially in the beginning when you are dealing with side effects, or when you hit a plateau. Just know to keeping pushing through (unless your side effects impact your daily life, then I would definitely recommend reaching out to your doctor). \n\nI am more than happy to answer any questions you might have. I am probably one of the early adopters of this medication (I like to say I had Ozempic face before it was cool to have Ozempic face) and in the beginning I was hesitant to tell anyone I was on this med. Over the last few years I have come to the conclusion I shouldn't be embarrassed. There is nothing to be embarrassed about and I should be proud of the hard work I put in during my journey (the meds help, yes... but you still have to do the work).\n\nCheers everyone!",

I just want to feel healthy and listen to my body. </p>\n\n<p>I’m still working on my relationship with food.

I’m not sure how long I’ll stay on Wygovy but I am going to wait until I am ready. </p>\n\n<p>It’s been a slow but steady progress.

I got my first dose a few weeks after getting home from that trip.

I was terrified of the possible side effects. My husband was really unhealthy with type II diabetes and severe sleep apnea. His doctor wanted him to start Moujaro, and I wanted to help support him so I decided to go in Semaglutide. To date he has lost like 150lbs, and I have lost 60 with minimal side effects. I can’t believe the change in my face. I just wish I could be as happy with the change in my body. I have a lost a crazy amount of inches, something like 39 in total, but the loose, flappy, crepey skin is messing with my head. I feel like I have more than my husband who has lost more than double the weight. I’m sure being in peri-menopause doesn’t help my case. I am proud of how far I’ve come, and can’t wait to lose another 60lbs. BTW I really love hearing everyone’s success stories. Everyone here truly is an inspiration! </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

I was going through pictures from our vacation in August of last year and I thought I’d try on some of the clothes I wore just to see how they fit now. As soon as I put this skirt on it definitely gave me a boost of confidence. I knew my clothes were definitely fitting differently but I can honestly say I didn’t realize how much of a difference it was. Take the pictures y’all! I love seeing everyone’s progress pictures. It has been such a great motivation for me during this process. I’m just sad I’ve waited this long to start taking pictures of myself to keep track of my progress.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

    "body": "Not gonna lie, I been frustrated lately. I'm been flirting up and down through the last 5 pounds—which finally dropped when I got a terrible kidney infection (ha!), and then immediately jumped back up. I don't want to only hit my goal because of sickness. I don't want to fight so hard for a number. I don't want to deal with the side effects of going up in dosage, because I'm already struggling with daily nausea. I don't want to have to spend 2 hours in the gym every day—an hour is plenty! I was feeling all kinds of grumpy and frustrated and self-pitying.\n\nAaaaaaand then I put on the shorts that I wore daily last summer.

I’ve never counted a single calorie or macro, just leaned into smarter food choices intuitively.</p>\n\n<p>Today, I’m officially in the average weight range. Not overweight. Not “fat.” And for someone who’s been overweight since birth, that’s monumental. I honestly didn’t expect it to work when I began, but I’m so grateful I gave it a shot.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

    "body": "SW: 190 (Nov 2024)\nCW: 140 (today)\nheight: 5’ 9”\n\nI honestly can’t believe what a difference this has made in my life - my habits, my energy, and of course my weight. I have always been a very active person but never really lost weight through my training. It was never necessarily a goal of mine to loose weight, but I knew there must be something that was causing my inability to shed any pounds. \n\nAfter semaglutide, I realized how much habitual snacking and drinking I was doing! Also found that I have a gluten intolerance, which was causing a lot of inflammation in my body. All to say, after 8 months I’ve lost 50lbs and have so much more energy!\n\nSo happy I can take these learnings and this feeling as motivation to continue to do what’s right for my body as I move off sema. I’m not trying to lose any more weight and now it’s about just treating my body well through my continued love for exercise coupled with fueling it in the right way!",
