    "body": "Here are some wild before and current pictures. I started on wegovy in August 2023 and moved to ozempic for insurance reasons. I’m 5’3” and my starting weight was 271. I’ve lost 136lbs and made it to the weight I’m going to maintain, 135lbs, right before vacation last week. \n\nHappy to answer any questions! But here are the things I’ve seen people ask / talk about over the last year and a half: \n\nYes I work out. I’m the person saying I workout 7 days a week 2x a day. I plan to continue this through maintenance. I also cut out a lot of foods and didn’t drink for 1 year and 4 months. I did have a couple drinks on vacation but still can’t get drunk or buzzed. I don’t think booze will be part of my life while I’m in maintenance for this reason, and I was formerly an enthusiastic social drinker. I’m going to lose 10 more lbs before I talk to my doctor about a maintenance dose so I have that wiggle room to figure out what dose will be best. Yes I’ve lost a ton of hair, NO I’m not any healthier or happier. I’m not a “completely different person” so although you may mean well you can respectfully keep those comments to yourself 🖤! I am still all about fat liberation and total body neutrality.  \n\nSocially no one treats me any different. No one has made any weird comments about my body or weight loss. Dating isn’t any better, I def pulled more dudes as a class III obese person. Physically I don’t feel any different, but I didn’t have any mobility issues previously. \n\nThat’s it! Again feel free to ask any questions! Hopefully this is helpful and best of luck to everyone, you got this! ",

I’m 5’3” and my starting weight was 271. I’ve lost 136lbs and made it to the weight I’m going to maintain, 135lbs, right before vacation last week. </p>\n\n<p>Happy to answer any questions! But here are the things I’ve seen people ask / talk about over the last year and a half: </p>\n\n<p>Yes I work out. I’m the person saying I workout 7 days a week 2x a day. I plan to continue this through maintenance. I also cut out a lot of foods and didn’t drink for 1 year and 4 months. I did have a couple drinks on vacation but still can’t get drunk or buzzed. I don’t think booze will be part of my life while I’m in maintenance for this reason, and I was formerly an enthusiastic social drinker. I’m going to lose 10 more lbs before I talk to my doctor about a maintenance dose so I have that wiggle room to figure out what dose will be best. Yes I’ve lost a ton of hair, NO I’m not any healthier or happier. I’m not a “completely different person” so although you may mean well you can respectfully keep those comments to yourself 🖤! I am still all about fat liberation and total body neutrality.  </p>\n\n<p>Socially no one treats me any different. No one has made any weird comments about my body or weight loss. Dating isn’t any better, I def pulled more dudes as a class III obese person. Physically I don’t feel any different, but I didn’t have any mobility issues previously. </p>\n\n<p>That’s it! Again feel free to ask any questions! Hopefully this is helpful and best of luck to everyone, you got this! </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

Unfortunately, I gained 50 lbs because of it. I stopped using it in 2021 and managed to lose some of the weight, but between 2021 and 2023, I kept fluctuating between 190-210 lbs.\n\nI tried everything: working out, eating healthy, even taking Metformin I ordered online and Phentermine from a med spa. Phentermine, in particular, gave me terrible side effects, so I talked to my primary care provider. They recommended Ozempic, and thankfully, my insurance approved it.\n\nI started Ozempic in January 2024, and as of today, I’ve lost about 50 lbs at a steady rate of 0.5-1 lb per week. I’ve been on the maximum dose of 2 mg for about 4 months now.\n\nMy Approach\nI intentionally chose to lose weight slowly because I wanted to avoid loose skin and set myself up for long-term success. I aim to eat around 1,500 calories per day because I eventually plan to wean off\n\nWeight History\n\nAt 18 years old: 208 lbs\nAt 25 years old: 155 lbs\nAt 36 years old (now): 158 lbs\nMy weight has fluctuated my entire life, so my body is somewhat used to these changes. Ive never been pregnant btw.\n\nIt’s been a challenging journey, but I’m finally in a place where I feel more confident and healthy.",

Unfortunately, I gained 50 lbs because of it. I stopped using it in 2021 and managed to lose some of the weight, but between 2021 and 2023, I kept fluctuating between 190-210 lbs.</p>\n\n<p>I tried everything: working out, eating healthy, even taking Metformin I ordered online and Phentermine from a med spa. Phentermine, in particular, gave me terrible side effects, so I talked to my primary care provider. They recommended Ozempic, and thankfully, my insurance approved it.</p>\n\n<p>I started Ozempic in January 2024, and as of today, I’ve lost about 50 lbs at a steady rate of 0.5-1 lb per week. I’ve been on the maximum dose of 2 mg for about 4 months now.</p>\n\n<p>My Approach\nI intentionally chose to lose weight slowly because I wanted to avoid loose skin and set myself up for long-term success. I aim to eat around 1,500 calories per day because I eventually plan to wean off</p>\n\n<p>Weight History</p>\n\n<p>At 18 years old: 208 lbs\nAt 25 years old: 155 lbs\nAt 36 years old (now): 158 lbs\nMy weight has fluctuated my entire life, so my body is somewhat used to these changes. Ive never been pregnant btw.</p>\n\n<p>It’s been a challenging journey, but I’m finally in a place where I feel more confident and healthy.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

I love how accepting and wonderful you all are in this community, so thank you, truly!!!\n\nI was on ozempic from Jan 2023-Sept 2023 and since stopping I’ve been keeping up on diet (eating in moderation) and light exercise and I am SO HAPPY to report the weight has continued to drop!!!! I’m honestly in disbelief?? I keep expecting to randomly gain it all back, or wake up and it will all have been a dream LOL. \n\nI wfh so I don’t have a huge need to replace any of my clothes; however, I’m on an extended vacation for the holiday and quickly realized the three pairs of jeans I have that “fit” me, didn’t actually fit me well at all… I went thrift shopping expecting to go down one pant size… I WENT DOWN TWO!!!! I fit into a size 4!!!!! I was NOT expecting that AT ALL! I still see myself as big, I can’t seem to wrap my head around the changing size of my body. \n\nHonestly, I’m just so blessed and so thankful that Ozempic quite literally saved my life.

I love how accepting and wonderful you all are in this community, so thank you, truly!!!</p>\n\n<p>I was on ozempic from Jan 2023-Sept 2023 and since stopping I’ve been keeping up on diet (eating in moderation) and light exercise and I am SO HAPPY to report the weight has continued to drop!!!! I’m honestly in disbelief?? I keep expecting to randomly gain it all back, or wake up and it will all have been a dream LOL. </p>\n\n<p>I wfh so I don’t have a huge need to replace any of my clothes; however, I’m on an extended vacation for the holiday and quickly realized the three pairs of jeans I have that “fit” me, didn’t actually fit me well at all… I went thrift shopping expecting to go down one pant size… I WENT DOWN TWO!!!! I fit into a size 4!!!!! I was NOT expecting that AT ALL! I still see myself as big, I can’t seem to wrap my head around the changing size of my body. </p>\n\n<p>Honestly, I’m just so blessed and so thankful that Ozempic quite literally saved my life. Ozempic is not a cure-all, it still takes the hard work and the dedication to wanting to improve your quality of life. It took a lot of motivation and discipline to get these results, Ozempic was just the push my body needed to be able to do it, and I’m so grateful.  </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

I was so tired of trying and failing, I hope and pray that this is the beginning of the rest of my life. I struggled with eating emotionally. I found my soothing and comfort in food. I would also never stop eating when I was full, if the food was still there and yummy. But now my whole mindset has changed. It’s so easy now to eat only when I’m hungry and stop when I’m full and exercise to take my mind off my stress.🥳🥹</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

My goal was 180, but I&#39;m happy and feeling fine at 185. My diabetes is gone, A1C from 13.4 in July 2023, down to 5.5 yesterday. Still taking 2.0, not gonna change anything. My digestive woes are gone, as long as I eat reasonably. Constipation is managed with a stool softener and daily flax fiber in my morning smoothie. Not riding my bike to work much since it&#39;s been freezing in the mornings, but I&#39;ll be back at it in the spring. Can&#39;t wait to see what constant exercise can do for my muscle tone. Not bad for a 58 year old dude. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

My blood pressure, A1C and cholesterol were out of control. </p>\n\n<p>I was 50 years old. That day I decided it was time to try again or I was probably going to be dead by 60 or sooner.

    "body": "For my birthday I was diagnosed with diabetes last year. The before photo was right around that time, but not my heaviest ever (that is the last comparison photo). We tried metformin etc at first but I couldn’t tolerate it so I got the OK from insurance to try Ozempic.\n\nHad hip surgery in November last year (torn labrum and they released my IT band), which is my 6th surgery in the past 10 years, all my joints are shot from being overweight. In March I started lifting weights 4x a week and in May I started biking 40 miles a week. Was astonished to find I could bike daily and not be super sore from the bike seat 😅\n\nTold my doc I’d like to try going off it next year. Deductible will reset and I can’t eat enough protein to do much good with the weight lifting. I count calories religiously (I weigh everything) and I’m at about 1300 per day, on a good day. Some days I don’t make it past 1100 calories even with all my activity. \n\nI plateaued for 4 months from February through May, then lost another 25lbs over the summer. Super close to my goal, which was 160 but I’m kinda hoping to get into the 150’s before I go off it and start focusing on building muscle. We will see. I am 46 years old and 5’10” so I don’t think 150’s is out of the question. I went from size 48 waist and I just bought jeans last week that are size 30. Might squeeze into 28’s before this is all over lol.\n\nIf anyone is on the fence about trying it I would say go for it honestly. I’m super disappointed in myself that I let things get that bad. Lots of loose skin and I don’t think I’ll ever build enough muscle to fill it out again at my age. Pissed off that I threw my late 20’s and all of my 30’s away like that. Frustrating, but I’m loving how I feel now. I can even sleep on my back without snoring 😂 The Mrs appreciates that I’m sure. ",

The before photo was right around that time, but not my heaviest ever (that is the last comparison photo). We tried metformin etc at first but I couldn’t tolerate it so I got the OK from insurance to try Ozempic.</p>\n\n<p>Had hip surgery in November last year (torn labrum and they released my IT band), which is my 6th surgery in the past 10 years, all my joints are shot from being overweight. In March I started lifting weights 4x a week and in May I started biking 40 miles a week. Was astonished to find I could bike daily and not be super sore from the bike seat 😅</p>\n\n<p>Told my doc I’d like to try going off it next year. Deductible will reset and I can’t eat enough protein to do much good with the weight lifting. I count calories religiously (I weigh everything) and I’m at about 1300 per day, on a good day. Some days I don’t make it past 1100 calories even with all my activity. </p>\n\n<p>I plateaued for 4 months from February through May, then lost another 25lbs over the summer. Super close to my goal, which was 160 but I’m kinda hoping to get into the 150’s before I go off it and start focusing on building muscle. We will see. I am 46 years old and 5’10” so I don’t think 150’s is out of the question. I went from size 48 waist and I just bought jeans last week that are size 30. Might squeeze into 28’s before this is all over lol.</p>\n\n<p>If anyone is on the fence about trying it I would say go for it honestly. I’m super disappointed in myself that I let things get that bad. Lots of loose skin and I don’t think I’ll ever build enough muscle to fill it out again at my age. Pissed off that I threw my late 20’s and all of my 30’s away like that. Frustrating, but I’m loving how I feel now. I can even sleep on my back without snoring 😂 The Mrs appreciates that I’m sure. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

    "body": "I have been taking Ozempic for over a year and have lost 75 pounds!  I feel great and all of my inflation has subsided, which is the greatest benefit for me.\n\nMy starting weight on Ozempic was 225 CW is 154.  I am 52, 5’2” and my current dosage is 1mg. As far as loose skin goes, I don’t really have very much.  I workout 5 days a week and do light weight training.  I also walk 2 miles daily.  I eat a lot of protein and vegetables but my problem was portion control.  I was overeating like crazy.  I am so grateful for this drug and all of its benefits.  The only side effect I had was constipation but that only lasted for about 2 weeks. \n\nI have about 20 pounds more to lose and my doctor has switched me over to Zepbound.  I will take my first dose on Saturday.  I was wondering if anyone has switched from Ozempic to Zepbound and what was your experience? I appreciate your help. Thank you! ",

So I always said that once I'd lost enough weight, I would work out. Its backwards, I know, but I chose to focus on diet and Ozempic for the bulk of my journey. But now I've finally gone from an Aus 18 to an Aus 10-12 (XXL - M) I'm not afraid anymore. \n\nSure, I'm super unfit from years of avoiding exercise like the plague. And yes everything is flabby right now from all the weightloss. But I'm putting the work in and have been doing reformer pilates every 2nd day. Instead of focusing on the number so much, my new goal is toning my body and being able to hold a plank without breaking before the instructor tells us to. \n\nAnd I'm only 8kg off my initial goal, so the day that comes I will celebrate. Sure it might take a little longer now that I'm building muscle. But when it does happen, I will truly know that I have worked hard and be so proud of myself. And honestly I wouldn't have been able to do it without Ozempic (I know, I've tried so many times before - stupid PCOS).\n\nAnyways, just wanted to share my journey update. Not quite there yet, but so damn close 😊",

I always kept to a 500 calorie deficit and reevaluated my calories to keep it accurate with my weight loss. </p>\n\n<p>The last few months I’ve stayed around the same weight which I’m happy with so I decided to lower my dose weekly until it ran out and this is the first shot day I will not be taking a shot! </p>\n\n<p>Loosing the weight have enabled me to take up running something I’ve found I enjoy so much and I’ve been completing 5k most days now which I am so proud of 🥹 </p>\n\n<p>I was so scared to take this drug in the beginning but honestly it is a miracle and I’m so happy it’s out there to help people like us 🙏</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

    "body": "A little back story: \n\n\nI’ve struggled with food for as long as I can remember. I used to have intense cravings and would gorge myself at birthday parties/holidays with junk food and dessert. When I got older, the cravings became unbearable.

    "body": "I started Ozempic back in November 2023 and stopped taking it at the end of September 2024. I have been off Ozempic, maintaining my weight since I stopped. It has certainly been a journey, and my weight will likely be a battle my whole life.  I wanted to share my maintenance journey with you all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Common Questions\n\n\n\nHow much weight did you lose?\n\n\n\n*I started at 293 lbs in September 2023, and today I weigh 181 lbs. (down 112 lbs)*\n\n\n\nHow have you been maintaining the weight loss?\n\n\n\n*I am more active than ever, and I work out/exercise every day. I play a lot of team sports and am part of a running club. I have been keeping a strict diet, with a weekly cheat day. I eat a lot cleaner and less greasy fast foods / take out.*\n\n\n\nDid the food noise come back?\n\n\n\n*OOOH Yeah! The hunger definitely comes back, but you just need to be consistent and strict with your diet. I do believe the diet is a huge part of maintaining the weight loss. I do a weekly meal prep for my work lunches, and I eat snacks and meals that are overall healthier. I have cut out all unnecessary sugars in my beverages.*\n\n\n\n  \n\nWould you recommend Ozempic?\n\n\n\n*Yes, I would recommend it to others. Ozempic really helped me to shed the weight. It was great to see the quick results. It can be discouraging when you feel like you’re doing everything right but you don’t see the scale reflecting that. If you need a kick start, and Ozempic works for you, I recommend it.*\n\n\n\n  \n\nPlans for the future?\n\n\n\n*I carry a lot of hanging skin since the weight loss, so I plan to continue working out and doing strength training to fill the loose skin with muscles. I also plan on continuing my healthier lifestyle with my diet and daily exercise.*",

I wanted to share my maintenance journey with you all.</p>\n\n<h1>Common Questions</h1>\n\n<p>How much weight did you lose?</p>\n\n<p><em>I started at 293 lbs in September 2023, and today I weigh 181 lbs. (down 112 lbs)</em></p>\n\n<p>How have you been maintaining the weight loss?</p>\n\n<p><em>I am more active than ever, and I work out/exercise every day. I play a lot of team sports and am part of a running club. I have been keeping a strict diet, with a weekly cheat day. I eat a lot cleaner and less greasy fast foods / take out.</em></p>\n\n<p>Did the food noise come back?</p>\n\n<p><em>OOOH Yeah! The hunger definitely comes back, but you just need to be consistent and strict with your diet. I do believe the diet is a huge part of maintaining the weight loss. I do a weekly meal prep for my work lunches, and I eat snacks and meals that are overall healthier. I have cut out all unnecessary sugars in my beverages.</em></p>\n\n<p>Would you recommend Ozempic?</p>\n\n<p><em>Yes, I would recommend it to others. Ozempic really helped me to shed the weight. It was great to see the quick results. It can be discouraging when you feel like you’re doing everything right but you don’t see the scale reflecting that. If you need a kick start, and Ozempic works for you, I recommend it.</em></p>\n\n<p>Plans for the future?</p>\n\n<p><em>I carry a lot of hanging skin since the weight loss, so I plan to continue working out and doing strength training to fill the loose skin with muscles. I also plan on continuing my healthier lifestyle with my diet and daily exercise.</em></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

    "body": "90kg > 57kg\n\nJust found a picture I didn't know I had in a secret folder on my phone. This is the most accurate photo I have of my highest weight, I really can't believe I use to be that big but I definitely remember how it felt. \n\nI found out about Ozempic and how it was helping those struggling with weight loss around the time of the before photo, unfortunately I put up with my growing knee pains from all the weight I was carrying and waited another couple of years before talking to my doctor- god why did I wait so long? I'm a lot healthier now and I should be happy, I am happy, but I'm still struggling to come to terms with the fact that I didn't have to punish myself for so long, it didn't need to be so hard, accepting myself could have been so much easier. I know your own weight shouldn't determine worth but something drives you to that point, and then when you're there nothing is simple.\n\n**If you're thinking about trying Ozempic do it.** Call, make the appointment, haul yourself in, tell your doctor straight up why you're there, don't 'spare' them from the personal issues either ok? Whatever's going to make your case stronger do it. I still suffer from bad knees and it could have been easily avoided. You're worth being listened to, your health is important, stop putting yourself on the backburner.\n\nJust rambling below, basically said my piece already.\n\nAnyway, 33kg lost yay. I did get down to 52kg around November last year and have been off and on Oz since then. I'm still currently 57kg so I have gained 5 but that happened in the span of about 2 months and I've lost/gained the same 1kg since then. \n\nMy period has just started to become irregular again (pcos girly) so I started the .25 dose today. I would like to lose more weight also, but the main priority is my cycle, so I'll gauge what dose I should be on based on that first- I also want to start exercising and see what I can lose from that too... basically playing it by ear now I guess?",

A little about my journey I guess. \n\nWhen I was 21 I was working an extremely physical job in managed to get down to a weight that I wasn't even at in high school (115). For the duration of time I had that job I was an excellent shape. Then gained it all back and then some over the next year. I've done almost every diet plan you could imagine.\n\nI had to convince doctors to put me on medication when I was in my mid 20s because I was at about 180 and I was scared. I was doing everything right but it wasn't working. I gained weight on the meds and The doctor accused me of being dishonest with all of my meticulous OCD level logs and pulled me off. Over the next few years I managed to get my self up to 240 (pic on left). \n\nI've done everything I could think to do. I got tested to make sure that there were no health issues and the doctors claim there's nothing medically wrong except prediabetic (diabetes runs in the family). So I finally found somebody that would listen to me and believes that there can be something medically causing this. I got approved for the semaglutide and this is the result so far. \n\nIt's changing how I interact with food. I am not usually a big appetite person in general but this doesn't nudge when I want food (not that much anyway), it effects how much I eat in a sitting though. I CANT eat more than a fistful of food before I feel like I just ate Thanksgiving dinner and I need a break. I can't eat as much at once so it's sort of change. Instead of a medium and a large meal everyday now I'm doing a little more snacking with fruit, cheese, hummus, veggies (A girl's got to have her cucumbers). And 2 small to medium meals. It's making a huge difference and I love how I feel! \n\nA bunch of people don't really agree with this medication so I don't feel comfortable talking too much about it with them. I guess I just wanted some acknowledgement that it's working and worth it. Thanks for hearing me out. ",

    "title": "Finally Under 300",
    "body": "I was obese throughout my childhood, at least from age 5. I weighed 325 lbs when I turned 18 years old, then spent about a year and a half getting down to 204 through lifestyle changes, fasting and liberal use of then-legal ephedrine supplements. I kept most of it off for about five years, fluctuating between 220 and 235. Then I failed myself, gaining back everything and then some, slowly over the next few years. I don’t know where I peaked, both because I was scared to weigh myself and because I maxed out my wife’s scale the one time I tried, but I suspect I was well north of 400 lbs. I worked hard with diet alone this January and February to lose weight (losing about 4-5 inches around my waist and belly and dropping a full size) and finally saw a doctor in March weighing in 368. I started on Oz in April and finally started to see real results when I got up to 1mg/week (I’m at 2mg/week now). I’m also doing intermittent fasting (10:30 am-6:30 pm) and generally avoiding anything processed or sugary (0 candy in October for the first time since I was a toddler), and my alcohol consumption went from moderate to very very low (0-3 beers/glasses of wine per week).\n\nI’m 6’3” and I haven’t been under 300 lbs since 2010, but I got there on Monday. I’m down to 297 as of this morning. My GW is 235, so I still have a way to go, but I’m savoring this milestone. I know this is still a massive amount of excess weight to carry, but my BMI dropped approximately 15 points (52-37) and I can almost see the light and the end of the tunnel. Shout out to the people at the State of California who negotiated my insurance plan with Kaiser Permanente for making this affordable ($20/pen).",
