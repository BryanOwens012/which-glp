So if you’re still following that first 2 months you may actually owe $1025/month. \n\nI hope this makes sense but you really need to call your insurance or at least look at your online portal bc u can price check there but they won’t tell you your deductible.  \n\nAlso your medical deductible is different than your prescription one.

They also did not sign you up for the coupon that’s provided for 12 months for the $25 copay everyone is talking about. This will help reduce your cost but those coupons have a maximum so for example:</p>\n\n<p>If your deductible is $3000 and the cost of the med is $1500/ month. You would need to pay for 2 months prior to meeting your out of pocket. The coupon may have a max coverage of let’s say $500. So you would be paying $1000/month the first two times. But the coupons is helping you “save” $1000 total. </p>\n\n<p>However calling the insurance is key to find out what the cost would be after that. Most times it’s still around $300-$500. But the coupon will bring that down. If it’s max is let’s say $500 with a $25 copay responsibility to the patient. Let’s say your insurance makes you pay $600 and the max the coupon covers is $500.

    "body": "61F\nSince February 16th when I started, it's 28 lb loss. I went from weighing once a week to twice a week just so I can make sure I'm on track.

Having a weirdo colon really seems to make it dangerous for me.  None of the side effects were worth it to me, I have a 12 year old that I need to care for, and I want to feel good.  I only wanted to lose 30 pounds, so I will see if I can up my walking or something. I have always had to work so hard to even shed a pound, so we'll see.  I may just resign myself to chubiness.  No more meds for me that slow digestion.  Thank you for your concern and congratulations on your weight loss!!9",

We seriously considered paying Lilly Direct and staying on Zep but for two of us it was beyond our budget now. Wegovy is now even cheaper than Zepbound was through our insurance. The entire thing is annoying. I hope we all do well. There’s a subreddit at <a href=\"/r/zepbound2wegovy\">r/zepbound2wegovy</a> where some of us are trying to navigate this.</p>\n</div>",

I won't necessarily have an appetite for anything, but I can munch on them slowly and start feeling better. Crystallized/candied ginger is also good for acute nausea. \n\nNot sure whether either of those could help you.

When I started it I only wanted to lose 55lbs more but the cardiologist wants me at my healthy weight which means losing 105lbs from my starting weight and that&#39;s why he referred me to the bariatric department of that hospital. While I&#39;m still on the waiting list I think I will get my name removed from it. </p>\n\n<p>Since starting wegovy I lost 68lbs which is more than I wanted to lose but still under what the cardiologist wants me to lose for my health. I have a serious cardiac condition which is why I&#39;m working so hard on getting to my healthy weight. It&#39;s only positive!</p>\n\n<p>Anyway that&#39;s my story, everyone has one and I&#39;m happy that I got to see your message.\nThank you for your message</p>\n</div>",

    "body": "Yes. Similarly, I took Wegovy for two years with mild symptoms — they were manageable and losing weight was a more prevalent concern to me. However, a little after that two year time frame, I ended up extremely sick and went to the ER 4x in one week. I had the worst nausea and vomiting of my life. Couldn’t keep down liquids or even light foods, couldn’t take prescription nausea meds, and kept having to return for fluids and IV meds. \n\nWent off of the Wegovy for a few months and my doctor said we could try it again as maybe my body had something else going on at the time that had exacerbated my symptoms all of a sudden. Went back on it some months later, took it for a few more months, then the same thing happened again. I ended up having so much bloodwork, ultrasounds to check for gallbladder issues, and a HIDA scan that revealed my gallbladder was working properly. \n\nSo I came off of the medication again. And I immediately began to gain weight as it appeared that my appetite returned to a greater amount than it had been prior to the Wegovy. I felt like a bottomless pit.  So my doctor then said we could try Zepbound since the chemical makeup of it is a little different than Wegovy. I took that for about six months before the same exact thing happened following an increase in dosage to 10mg and I was forced to discontinue it as well.. \n\nIn the time since, I have gained back all of my weight except for two lbs and I am very unhappy,  but I can’t take GLP-1 meds and that’s all the focus is on currently. I have tried to make necessary lifestyle changes, but my weight won’t budge and it’s so disheartening . I get memories on my phone daily of how I looked this time last year and I’m just so sad that I worked so hard for nothing. \n\nWith that being said, I feel that these medicines do have severe side effects in some cases and can be dangerous. I think that over time we will see more people with complications due to the influx of people taking them. Nothing is a miracle drug as much as we want it to be. I just wish some of us didn’t have to try so hard.",

However, a little after that two year time frame, I ended up extremely sick and went to the ER 4x in one week. I had the worst nausea and vomiting of my life. Couldn’t keep down liquids or even light foods, couldn’t take prescription nausea meds, and kept having to return for fluids and IV meds. \n\nWent off of the Wegovy for a few months and my doctor said we could try it again as maybe my body had something else going on at the time that had exacerbated my symptoms all of a sudden. Went back on it some months later, took it for a few more months, then the same thing happened again. I ended up having so much bloodwork, ultrasounds to check for gallbladder issues, and a HIDA scan that revealed my gallbladder was working properly. \n\nSo I came off of the medication again. And I immediately began to gain weight as it appeared that my appetite returned to a greater amount than it had been prior to the Wegovy. I felt like a bottomless pit.  So my doctor then said we could try Zepbound since the chemical makeup of it is a little different than Wegovy. I took that for about six months before the same exact thing happened following an increase in dosage to 10mg and I was forced to discontinue it as well.. \n\nIn the time since, I have gained back all of my weight except for two lbs and I am very unhappy,  but I can’t take GLP-1 meds and that’s all the focus is on currently. I have tried to make necessary lifestyle changes, but my weight won’t budge and it’s so disheartening . I get memories on my phone daily of how I looked this time last year and I’m just so sad that I worked so hard for nothing. \n\nWith that being said, I feel that these medicines do have severe side effects in some cases and can be dangerous. I think that over time we will see more people with complications due to the influx of people taking them. Nothing is a miracle drug as much as we want it to be. I just wish some of us didn’t have to try so hard.",

Treat increasing your dose as an exhaustible resource because you can only go up so far.",

My guts were in knots, ab pains all the time. Eating was not fun. by the second month I avoided eating because the euphoria became misery. \n\nThere was a point where I had ti make an effort to get 1000 calories in each day. I would literally forget to eat.  Got so bad for a while it came to a head when I almost passed out several times.  \n\nI thought about quitting because I was always uncomfortable and eating was becoming a chore. But anyway you decide to lose wait its uncomfortable.  Its not an easy thing to do no matter the path, including this one. \n\nIts a grind dealing with the side effects etc. But if I didnt grind with wegovy I would have to grind some other way. \n\nEach time my dose increased the grind does as well.   So as I am sitting here typing this my stomach is tender and all I have “eaten” was my morning coffee and I have no interest in thinking about what I am going to eat later. \n\nThe upside is I do get to eat whatever I want. But instead of crushing a whole pizza I am lucky to get down two pieces. Instead of taking on a 16oz ribeye, loaded baker, I share one with my wife and can barely finish. \n\nOne of my biggest cravings was sandwiches. I loved (and still do somewhat) a good sub; Philly cheese, Italian, Ruben, you name it. \nIt was always large, extra meat, extra cheese several times a week. \n\nNow its half a sub maybe every other week and I am totally cool with it. I still get to enjoy the foods I love and eating smaller portions has become completely satisfying because wegovy makes it a task to finish those last couple of bites. \n\nI will close with there were times I did indulge. Its not fool proof. There will be times you have to put the fork down on your own and your weight will go up and down.  But wegovy is a tool to make things go down more than up easier. Dont consider it a silver bullet but just a little help to get to the end game. \n\nIt will be roller coaster at times. Dont get discouraged. Just grind. It works!!",

Some days are better than others. Last week, the side effects were brutal. Worst stomach ache ever and....other side effects. This week is better, but nothing will compare to Zepbound. Other than being a bit tired, I felt so good from the 1st shot. Mental clarity, motivation, and one of the best NSVs I experienced was that my tinnitus was nearly unnoticeable. It is now back with a vengeance since I started Wegovy. \n\nAll that said, my journey will not be deterred. I will continue doing what I am doing and be patient. I have come too far to just ignore my progress and give up (sw: 372 cw: 334) I am hopeful that once my dose increases, some of what I lost will return. If not, my next doctor's appointment is at the end of October. If I still feel the same, I will try to get my doctor to fight Caremark for me. Not sure if that's even an option, but we shall see. Either way, they will not break me!",

The dry eye seemed to stop when I did that. Unfortunately, so did the weight loss. I completely stalled. So, after three weeks of giving the shot in my thigh, I moved back to my stomach. The weight loss started again, but the dry eye didn’t. I can’t explain it. </p>\n\n<p>So my advice is to try the shot in a different location. </p>\n\n<p>Funny thing: when I was giving the shot in my thigh and the weight loss stopped, my appetite and food noise <em>didn’t</em> come back. I was eating the same amount I did before. But no weight loss. This tells me this med does more than just suppress my appetite so I eat less. I think it does something to my metabolism. </p>\n\n<p>That’s not good news if I had hoped to get off the med someday. But I think I’ve made my peace with staying on it long term.</p>\n</div>",

She was surprised that they didn&#39;t come back with additional requests.

    "body": "Caremark insurance and was 1 pound from being a BMI of 24. I switched days after the announcement at my weight check in May where I was still officially “overweight”.\n\nWent from 10mg to 1.7 mg and I injected my 6th 1.7mg shot last Wednesday.\n\nI had minor nausea and heartburn with Zepbound. With Wegovy, I have no nausea and same amount of heartburn, but the constipation is so much worse. \n\nThe first month I didn’t lose anything but I know as a pharmacy tech who works in an endocrinology clinic that one needs to patient. My body was used to one med and now it had levels of both meds in it and had no idea what to do.  I went up and down and up and down and since 6/24, I’ve been down.  I think I’d be down more if I wasn’t so full of crap….literally.  I started a stool softener nightly and I finally went yesterday and today. But I know there’s more. It’ll be interesting to see how that fun side effect affects my weigh ins. \n\nMy insurance may not have dropped Zepbound. I worked July 1st and was off on PTO, so didn’t have a chance to see if anyone else at work had issues yet. I just did not want to chance waiting knowing I was one good poop away from being a healthy BMI. I work with the PA’s on these meds enough to not risk it and just make sure I was on something.\n\nNext weight check is the end of this month but if I have to do a stool softener or laxative daily, I’m hoping I can potentially go back to Zepbound. Hopefully by then there’s more solid info on what’s needed for a formulary exception if needed. In the meantime, I’ll up my protein with Fiber one bars….see if that helps.\n\nLike not mad I don’t have nausea, but I think I’d rather nausea than this level of constipation. I have endometriosis also and while nausea is my worst symptom, I had lesions on my rectum, so the extra constipation is just making every day more painful and triggers the nausea. I’d rather just have the nausea….",

    "body": "Prune juice worked better for me. Most stores sell the little cans, which come in packs of 4. They are more gentle on the stomach and work overnight.
