    "body": "Started on wegovy in summer of 2022 first pic is 280lbs. Second pic is recent and I weigh about 205 lbs. The medication has been life changing for me. Despite being an athlete and using the gym I used to struggle with losing weight, binge eating and alcohol consumption, and this medication completely put a stop to that. I had little/few side effects on this except for occasional constipation/gas and some nausea when I would eat too much. I understand some of the depression claims, but on other diets I would feel that way as well occasionally so really I attribute the downs to the caloric deficit. Prior to the prescription I had started to develop a consistent high intensity fitness routine of 3-5x per week (1 hour cardio + 1 hour lift) at the gym. I’ve stuck with the fitness routine throughout, but found the wegovy allowed me to focus on my goal and prevented me from binge eating when I do snack. I also lost interest in binge drinking due to the medication which was a big boost to my progress. You don’t realize how harmful those not so occasional binges are to your progress. You will stall if you don’t take the exercise program seriously, and I find the regular progress requirement in weight loss by my doctor/insurer to be a good motivator. Health Insurance (Aetna premium) covered the prescription and only cost $25 a month for me and was prescribed through PlushCare which I find to be a great telehealth provider. \n\nNot sweating constantly anymore, able to run a mile comfortably, and the gain in confidence was worth every penny and amount of energy I put into this. My entire life I’ve been overweight and I’ve always received a lot of negative attention from people due to that. That seems to have gone away and life overall is just more a positive experience. If anyone has any questions, post a comment and I’ll try to get back to you.",

I have been doing really well on Zepbound. \n\nMy doctor switched me from Zepbound 7.5 to Wegovy 1.0. Since the switch, I have had almost zero side effects. I was typically nauseous for 3 days post my Zepbound injection and had to take Zofran to even think about eating. \n\nOn Wegovy my appetite is still suppressed, but the nausea is gone. Which means no more gagging when I open the fridge and no more having to force myself to eat. This feels like a win to me! \n\nMy stomach does get a little upset the day after my shot—but it’s totally manageable and dependent on what I ate the day before. The worst thing about the Wegovy is the pen. I absolutely hate it! They need to move to the button ASAP! \n\nSo far so good for me. Sounds like I’m one of the lucky ones!",

It&#39;s been a lifelong journey with ups and downs over approximately 15 years.</p>\n\n<p>When I lost the weight, I found huge inspiration in others who were willing to share their journey. It gave me constant motivation to keep pushing further. Thank you to everyone who shared your story!</p>\n\n<p>I have therefore created a YouTube channel with the goal and ambition of giving back and hopefully motivating and inspiring others — just as I was.</p>\n\n<p>If you are interested, you can find my channel and my story here: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@FreddieFitness1\">https://www.youtube.com/@FreddieFitness1</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

Still plateauing on wegovy, and will likely go to 1.0mg.\n\nWhat I’m noticing is that appetite suppression is different on wegovy.  On zepbound, my appetite was generally lower, and food noise (untill the last 5 wks on zep) was generally absent.\n\nOn wegovy, appetite and food noise suppression feels stronger for fatty foods.

Still plateauing on wegovy, and will likely go to 1.0mg.</p>\n\n<p>What I’m noticing is that appetite suppression is different on wegovy.  On zepbound, my appetite was generally lower, and food noise (untill the last 5 wks on zep) was generally absent.</p>\n\n<p>On wegovy, appetite and food noise suppression feels stronger for fatty foods. I lost my taste for meat. But my sweet tooth has returned. There’s food noise for sweets, and the ability to easily stop after a few bites of desert without willpower seems gone.</p>\n\n<p>Has anybody else who’s taken both experienced this difference in suppression?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

No one had any idea I had lost any weight or that I was even trying to lose weight. I have now been with them for the past 3 days and not one single person hs had anything at all to say bout my losing weight. \nI don’t really see a difference in myself but my husband has told me there is a big difference and I know there must be. I was wearing size 18 pants at my highest weight and just before I left to come back here I tried on some jeans just to see if there was any way I could wear pants that actually had a zipper and a button. Well low and behold I was able to fit into a size 12. I was in shock. I haven’t worn any pants that weren’t elastic waist in so long I couldn’t believe it. My old clothes are way too big now so I’m sure I have lost weight and it must be noticeable. \nMy only concern coming back was what I was going to tell them when they asked how I lost the weight. I really didn’t want to share this with anyone except my husband.  \nWell, I got my answer. I didn’t have to say anything because they didn’t even notice. \nAt first I was hurt but then I remembered in the very beginning I had told my husband I was doing this because I wanted to feel better in my skin not for how I would look. \nI don’t really think anyone is jealous or anything like that. I truly think they don’t see any difference. Is it possible to lose that much weight and it not be noticeable?\nAnyone else experience this?\n",

Have you done it, how's it going?\n\nI'm 38, 5'3\", started @ August last yr @ 195. Currently 135ish. I took a month off in February (my bday month lol). I worked up to 1.75, but only a few month's cuz I couldn't eat on that dose. 1mg has been my \"sweet spot\" been on it for month's,but since I don't technically wna lose anymore I thought about injecting the 1mg monthly. It's been roughly 3wks since my last 1mg dose, was going to do it tonight but chickened out lol. Any helpful advice appreciated🫶🏼",

After being diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, I went from 170 pounds with visible abs to 240 pounds within a year, largely due to the metabolic effects of antipsychotics.\n\nI was put on the lowest dose of Abilify, which is supposed to have the least likelihood of weight gain, but I still gained 15 pounds in the first month even while training six days a week, doing push pull legs for two hours a day. After that, the weight gain slowed to about 5 to 10 pounds per month for a few months, then 1 to 5 pounds per month after that.\n\nI tried multiple antipsychotics and combinations with things like Wellbutrin and Adderall, medications with lower metabolic side effects, but nothing worked. Finally, I went to my doctor and said, “I’m a high-functioning person with a psychotic disorder, I work out consistently, and here are my weight charts. I think the meds have caused metabolic syndrome, and semaglutides might be my only option.” He agreed, and after prior authorization, my insurance covered it under “medicine induced metabolic disorder.”\n\nAfter a year on Wegovy, I’m back down to 185 pounds with almost no side effects. The biggest surprise has been the mental health benefits. Abilify is known to cause problems with impulse control like gambling, reckless behavior, and overindulgence in anything that spikes dopamine. But since starting Wegovy, my impulse control feels normal again. I don’t drive recklessly, I don’t drink and party like I used to, and I don’t get randomly angry like I did early on.\n\nOn top of that, I’ve seen huge improvements at work. I earn about 140k a year, and when I was first hospitalized, I worried that the cognitive effects of Abilify like slower thinking and poor focus would ruin my career. But since starting Wegovy, my performance has bounced back to where it was before my psychotic break.",

And wearing a men’s small which is fairly close to a women’s medium. \n\nI was losing a little bit of weight prior to starting Wegovy but it was a struggle. As of Sept 2024, I’m down 44lbs. In total I’m down 85lbs from my lowest weight.\n\nAll that to say: it’s worth it, don’t give up! Unless the side effects are so bad that you’re sick, keep going.

I’ve mostly been eating tofu & veggie soups, chicken & rice with veggies, turkey tacos, eggs, and recently added beans & legumes. I also do a vegan protein shake with almond milk. I’m trying to drink more water as well.\n\nI’ve had to take a laxative twice because the stool softeners are not working. I really don’t want to take laxatives because I know your body can become dependent on them. Prior to starting wegovy, I was going to the bathroom 3-4 times a day. Which I think was because I have a mushroom intolerance. I cut out mushrooms and was going 2 times a day.\n\nThe issue with food intake is that I’m just really not that hungry anymore. Or when I eat, I can get about 4-5 small bites in before I feel full and can’t even look at food anymore. \n\nAnyone else experience this and can give some advice? Thank you!! ☺️ ",

I have had virtually no side effects as long as I keep hydrated. Reading through some posts in this group when I first started, I would get a little frustrated. So many people were seeing results at low doses and I was not seeing much appetite suppression. The main thing I immediately noticed was no desire to drink anything but water, and I consumed more soda than I would like to admit prior to starting. I am now starting to see the appetite suppression and have started to track calories to ensure I consume enough food on a daily basis. As of today I have lost 20 pounds!

The Dr increased my dose to 1.7mg. It has made no difference at all. I feel no change. \nI'm curious if anyone else has had this happen? ",

I think I’m going to make my mom or boyfriend do it the first couple of times, but any advice is appreciated! </p>\n\n<p>Update: I made my mom do it since she’s been on a different but similar GLP-1 for at least a year now. At first she didn’t push in as hard as she needed and we were both confused, luckily no medication came out. And once she did press in I was distracted by how much I didn’t feel it at first that it wasn’t that bad! She did laugh at me for trying to swat at her though lol </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

I walked out $151.00 richer (because girl math🤣) \nI&#39;m so glad the price has come down, I know several people who couldn&#39;t do the $650 but the $499. Might be the difference for them. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

She constantly feels tired and drained.  \n(she has last close to 40 lbs which I'm so proud of her for)\n\nAnybody experienced this from the drug? I've read a few other post and some mention depression, some say their sex drive disappeared, others also said they're fatigued, I've heard birth control can make you view your partner differently (I'm not sure if this is true or not, also know lots of drugs can change your state of mind too) if so does this drug have a similar affect?\n\nBefore anyone says it, yes I have communicated with her about it and shes not sure why she feels the way she does either.

    "title": "Anyone else have this experience? Re: possible allergic reaction to Wegovy",
    "body": "Looking to see if anyone else has had a similar experience. Sorry this is so long, not sure if the details are that important. This is my first post so please bear with me. I’ve been on wegovy since 7/29. I did 4 doses of .25, 4 doses of .50, this past Saturday (9/28) evening before bed was my 2nd dose of 1mg. I woke up Sunday extremely nauseous and dry heaving. I’ve experienced minor nausea with all other doses but 1mg required me to use Zofran the day after injection. Sunday morning I thought I got bit by something because I had 2 bumps on my arm and was super itchy. Mid day my pointer fingers became very stiff, itchy and swollen, then both of my hands became very itchy and swollen, palms super red and my hands felt like they were on fire. I took Allegra because it was the only thing I had on hand, it didn’t really help per se but things didn’t get worse. I woke up at 430am Monday morning from a dead sleep because of the itching and burning in my hands. Later in the morning I developed hives and rashes all over my arms, my face and thighs. I did a telehealth urgent care appt and the Dr said it was likely the wegovy, told me to take Benadryl and they called me in some anti itch cream to help. I ended up with a fever of 101.7, felt like I got hit by a truck, was sure I had Covid on top of an allergic reaction but my Covid test was negative. I slept most of the day and woke up about 6pm, I couldn’t take the pain in my hands anymore and I could barely stay awake. My bottom lip started to swell and my eyelids had huge hives to the point where I could see my eyelids with my eyes open. The lip swelling had me freaked out that it could be moving to my throat. My husband brought me to urgent care, my heart rate was higher than normal, so they made me sit and wait until my heart rate came down. This Dr seems to think it was the Zofran. He told me to keep taking Benadryl, gave me prednisone and 2 Pepcid (said it helps with aniphalaxsis). He recommended the ER for observation but I told him I didn’t want to go unless I absolutely needed to. He called me in an epi pen in case it did start to affect my breathing. I woke up this Tuesday morning hands felt almost normal, lip swelling gone, rash where I had hives but no active hives. About 11am my top lip started swelling, and hives started coming back. I took my steroids, Benadryl, Pepcid and used my anti itch cream, the lip swelling went down but not away completely and I kept getting hives off an on (like 3 times all day). I woke up today (Wednesday) all swelling gone, but still a rash where I had hives yesterday. I took my allergy cocktail as prescribed, got to work and am now actively breaking out in hives again. I thought by now (3 days of Benadryl and steroids) the active hives would stop. This is leading me to believe it is the wegovy because it's still in my system and I assume at this point the zofran is long gone, last dose was Sunday at 10-1030am.\n\nIs it possibly from bumping up to the higher dose? Could I possibly go back down to .50 since I didn’t have any of these reactions on that dose? If not, could zepbound or monjaro be an option or am I likely going to have the same reaction? I did also just start taking Wellbutrin about 3 weeks ago, but the urgent care Dr said it’s unlikely the reaction would be to that if I’ve been on it for weeks with no issues. I’m down 25 lbs and overall feeling so much better. I still have about 80 lbs to lose and am now feeling so discouraged. I definitely do not want to risk it being worse if I try another shot of the 1mg but really do not want to quit. I messaged my dr, she told me it could be anything, asked that I stop the wegovy and asked me to schedule an appt for asap. The first avail was 10/16 so now I'll miss 2 doses and am so worried my progress is going to stop and I'm going to gain back. I've read other posts where people have had minor rash or hives but have continued with no reaction after but I think my reaction was a bit worse than minor. Thanks to those that stuck with me reading my novel and thanks in advanced to anyone who shares their experience\n(I posted in the wegovy weight loss sub as well, so sorry if this is repetitive. Just trying to reach as many people as possible to see if I'm the only one with this experience.)\n\nETA:: had a follow up with my dr today, based on the timeline and symptoms she is comfortable with me trying the wegovy again. We believe it was the Wellbutrin that caused the reaction based on my symptoms and timeline matching MANY others who described the same reaction from Wellbutrin. \nWe have a plan in place should the allergy be from wegovy and I’m totally comfortable with it so I will be going back on the 1mg; fingers crossed the side effects won’t be terrible since it’s been 2.5 weeks since my last injection 🤞🏼",

This is my first post so please bear with me. I’ve been on wegovy since 7/29. I did 4 doses of .25, 4 doses of .50, this past Saturday (9/28) evening before bed was my 2nd dose of 1mg. I woke up Sunday extremely nauseous and dry heaving. I’ve experienced minor nausea with all other doses but 1mg required me to use Zofran the day after injection. Sunday morning I thought I got bit by something because I had 2 bumps on my arm and was super itchy. Mid day my pointer fingers became very stiff, itchy and swollen, then both of my hands became very itchy and swollen, palms super red and my hands felt like they were on fire. I took Allegra because it was the only thing I had on hand, it didn’t really help per se but things didn’t get worse. I woke up at 430am Monday morning from a dead sleep because of the itching and burning in my hands. Later in the morning I developed hives and rashes all over my arms, my face and thighs. I did a telehealth urgent care appt and the Dr said it was likely the wegovy, told me to take Benadryl and they called me in some anti itch cream to help. I ended up with a fever of 101.7, felt like I got hit by a truck, was sure I had Covid on top of an allergic reaction but my Covid test was negative. I slept most of the day and woke up about 6pm, I couldn’t take the pain in my hands anymore and I could barely stay awake. My bottom lip started to swell and my eyelids had huge hives to the point where I could see my eyelids with my eyes open. The lip swelling had me freaked out that it could be moving to my throat. My husband brought me to urgent care, my heart rate was higher than normal, so they made me sit and wait until my heart rate came down. This Dr seems to think it was the Zofran. He told me to keep taking Benadryl, gave me prednisone and 2 Pepcid (said it helps with aniphalaxsis). He recommended the ER for observation but I told him I didn’t want to go unless I absolutely needed to. He called me in an epi pen in case it did start to affect my breathing. I woke up this Tuesday morning hands felt almost normal, lip swelling gone, rash where I had hives but no active hives. About 11am my top lip started swelling, and hives started coming back. I took my steroids, Benadryl, Pepcid and used my anti itch cream, the lip swelling went down but not away completely and I kept getting hives off an on (like 3 times all day). I woke up today (Wednesday) all swelling gone, but still a rash where I had hives yesterday. I took my allergy cocktail as prescribed, got to work and am now actively breaking out in hives again. I thought by now (3 days of Benadryl and steroids) the active hives would stop. This is leading me to believe it is the wegovy because it&#39;s still in my system and I assume at this point the zofran is long gone, last dose was Sunday at 10-1030am.</p>\n\n<p>Is it possibly from bumping up to the higher dose? Could I possibly go back down to .50 since I didn’t have any of these reactions on that dose? If not, could zepbound or monjaro be an option or am I likely going to have the same reaction? I did also just start taking Wellbutrin about 3 weeks ago, but the urgent care Dr said it’s unlikely the reaction would be to that if I’ve been on it for weeks with no issues. I’m down 25 lbs and overall feeling so much better. I still have about 80 lbs to lose and am now feeling so discouraged. I definitely do not want to risk it being worse if I try another shot of the 1mg but really do not want to quit. I messaged my dr, she told me it could be anything, asked that I stop the wegovy and asked me to schedule an appt for asap. The first avail was 10/16 so now I&#39;ll miss 2 doses and am so worried my progress is going to stop and I&#39;m going to gain back. I&#39;ve read other posts where people have had minor rash or hives but have continued with no reaction after but I think my reaction was a bit worse than minor. Thanks to those that stuck with me reading my novel and thanks in advanced to anyone who shares their experience\n(I posted in the wegovy weight loss sub as well, so sorry if this is repetitive.
