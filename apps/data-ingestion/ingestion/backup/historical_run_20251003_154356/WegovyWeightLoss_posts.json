    "body": "Here are some wild before and current pictures. I started on wegovy in August 2023 and moved to ozempic for insurance reasons. I’m 5’3” and my starting weight was 271. I’ve lost 136lbs and made it to the weight I’m going to maintain, 135lbs, right before vacation last week. \n\nHappy to answer any questions! But here are the things I’ve seen people ask / talk about over the last year and a half: \n\nYes I work out. I’m the person saying I workout 7 days a week 2x a day. I plan to continue this through maintenance. I also cut out a lot of foods and didn’t drink for 1 year and 4 months. I did have a couple drinks on vacation but still can’t get drunk or buzzed. I don’t think booze will be part of my life while I’m in maintenance for this reason, and I was formerly an enthusiastic social drinker. I’m going to lose 10 more lbs before I talk to my doctor about a maintenance dose so I have that wiggle room to figure out what dose will be best. Yes I’ve lost a ton of hair, NO I’m not any healthier or happier. I’m not a “completely different person” so although you may mean well you can respectfully keep those comments to yourself 🖤! I am still all about fat liberation and total body neutrality.  \n\nSocially no one treats me any different. No one has made any weird comments about my body or weight loss. Dating isn’t any better, I def pulled more dudes as a class III obese person. Physically I don’t feel any different, but I didn’t have any mobility issues previously. \n\nThat’s it! Again feel free to ask any questions! Hopefully this is helpful and best of luck to everyone, you got this! ",

I’m 5’3” and my starting weight was 271. I’ve lost 136lbs and made it to the weight I’m going to maintain, 135lbs, right before vacation last week. </p>\n\n<p>Happy to answer any questions! But here are the things I’ve seen people ask / talk about over the last year and a half: </p>\n\n<p>Yes I work out. I’m the person saying I workout 7 days a week 2x a day. I plan to continue this through maintenance. I also cut out a lot of foods and didn’t drink for 1 year and 4 months. I did have a couple drinks on vacation but still can’t get drunk or buzzed. I don’t think booze will be part of my life while I’m in maintenance for this reason, and I was formerly an enthusiastic social drinker. I’m going to lose 10 more lbs before I talk to my doctor about a maintenance dose so I have that wiggle room to figure out what dose will be best. Yes I’ve lost a ton of hair, NO I’m not any healthier or happier. I’m not a “completely different person” so although you may mean well you can respectfully keep those comments to yourself 🖤! I am still all about fat liberation and total body neutrality.  </p>\n\n<p>Socially no one treats me any different. No one has made any weird comments about my body or weight loss. Dating isn’t any better, I def pulled more dudes as a class III obese person. Physically I don’t feel any different, but I didn’t have any mobility issues previously. </p>\n\n<p>That’s it! Again feel free to ask any questions! Hopefully this is helpful and best of luck to everyone, you got this! </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

I didn’t even think I would make it to that. And in March I did! So I decided to make my goal 55kg (the weight I was in 2021 prior to my weight gain) 55 sounded so unrealistic and only a dream. I never thought I would ever reach that weight again. I finally feel like my old self again after all these years. \nIt has been a real roller coaster of a journey, days where I felt fatigue, days where my body did not want to eat, lost hair on the way, having plateaus and thought that’s it I’m not going to lose anymore weight. But it has been all worth it in the end. My doctor has lowered my dose to 1.7mg and eventually will go on 1mg for maintenance. I plan to get off wegovy end of the year. I will forever be grateful for Wegovy teaching me how to have a healthy relationship with food again ❤️ and I’ve absolutely loved being on this journey with you all 🥰</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

I still have about 14 lbs to my goal weight, but I am so happy with my journey. I went from obese to a normal BMI. Sometimes I still look in the mirror and dislike my body, but when I compare side by side pictures like this, it’s astonishing how far I have come! I am learning to listen and respect my body. I have changed my eating habits. I have changed my sleeping habits. I exercise 2-3 times per week. I am taking care of myself. I am learning to love myself. 🩷\nChange is possible and learn to trust the process! ",

Lucky I have a great team of doctors and I started to take this life changing medication and I have accomplished my goals of taking my life back and have a second chance at life. This has been a complete life style change and I’m proof that if you don’t give up you can reach your goals. Please feel free to ask me any questions. Here is a picture of me in pants that I was able to fit in one leg. I went from size 78 to 34 pants and 8x to XL shirts. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

Fast forward to now, and I’ve lost 135 pounds. But more importantly, I’ve gained my life back.\n\nRecovery from food addiction isn’t just about the scale. It’s about healing your relationship with food, your body, and your worth. Through clean eating, CrossFit, yoga, and a maintenance dose of compound semaglutide every two weeks, I’ve built a lifestyle that supports both my physical and mental health.\n\nThe transformation hasn’t just been physical—my confidence has exploded. I move differently. I speak differently. I look in the mirror and feel proud of who I am. I’m not hiding anymore. I show up for myself and for my life in ways I never imagined.\n\nThis journey wasn’t easy. But it was worth it. I’m living in alignment with my goals, my values, and my dreams. I’m living my best life, and I’m so deeply grateful—for the support, the tools, and most of all, for the second chance to become the person I was always meant to be.\n\nTo anyone struggling: it’s possible.

Fast forward to now, and I’ve lost 135 pounds. But more importantly, I’ve gained my life back.</p>\n\n<p>Recovery from food addiction isn’t just about the scale. It’s about healing your relationship with food, your body, and your worth. Through clean eating, CrossFit, yoga, and a maintenance dose of compound semaglutide every two weeks, I’ve built a lifestyle that supports both my physical and mental health.</p>\n\n<p>The transformation hasn’t just been physical—my confidence has exploded. I move differently. I speak differently. I look in the mirror and feel proud of who I am. I’m not hiding anymore. I show up for myself and for my life in ways I never imagined.</p>\n\n<p>This journey wasn’t easy. But it was worth it. I’m living in alignment with my goals, my values, and my dreams. I’m living my best life, and I’m so deeply grateful—for the support, the tools, and most of all, for the second chance to become the person I was always meant to be.</p>\n\n<p>To anyone struggling: it’s possible. Keep going.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

At the start of my journey almost 6 years ago I was 200 kg (440 lbs) and not able to enjoy anything in life. After the initial weightloss from the surgery, I had more energy than before but these last 40 kg I have lost have really impacted my life. I now exercise daily, sometimes twice a day. Every single thing in life is easier. I work out 3-4 times a week, and two weeks ago I started training for a 10K! I try to incorporate protein into every meal but I eat everything I want, even sweets. Just in moderation. I used to be a binge eater but that isn't part of my life now. I wonder if I will be on the medication for the rest of my life, I want to start muscle building but that is hard when I can only eat so much, even if it is healthy. But for now, I am not far from reaching my goal weight or rather, my goal fat percentage (it's now 21.7%) of 15%. I had a consult with a plastic surgeon last month about fleur-de-lis surgery and other skin reduction surgeries and he thinks I qualify, although the cost is sadly high and not covered by the state health insurance in my country. But I try to be positive and enjoy this new life of mine!",

I hit my 100 in September and have been on maintenance (1.7 every ten days) and been maintaining. I didn’t change the foods I eat (we eat pretty healthy. Cook at home. My son is celiac so we stay away from flour and eat mostly whole foods) just the quantity. \n\nThis medication also helped my tummy issues. My body was “digesting” my foods too quickly, causing malabsorption and diarrhea - every time I’d eat something. I’m digesting my foods. Haven’t had diarrhea in nearly two years. My vitamin levels are finally at normal levels. I would take this even if it just fixed my belly issues. \n\nIt also helped with my addictions to cigarettes, alcohol and shopping! I haven’t smoked in over two years. I just have no urge. No urge to shop for random things. No urge to drink alcohol. \n\nMy side effects were yucky. A lot of nausea and vomiting, mostly in the beginning as my body got used to new doses. \n\nI wish every one of you success on this product. I tell everyone, without shame, that I’m using this. It’s been a wonderful tool in my toolbox. \n\nCheers 🙌",

I met my Doc today and we agreed to keep me on wegovy at the lowest effective dose for me. Right now I am at .50mg. I am in Canada so its easy for me with the dial to adjust as I go.\nMy relationship with food is completely different from a year ago. I still very much enjoy food, I just crave different foods and I am satisfied with smaller portions. </p>\n\n<p>A year ago I started walking everyday and I stayed consistent, that’s a big achievement for me. Discipline never was my strong suit. So while I did the work, wegovy really gave me the kick in the butt that I needed. </p>\n\n<p>My word to you : Be proud of yourself and f*ck the haters that say Semaglutide is the easy way to do it. Sure it helps, just as my antidepressants helps keep my anxiety in check. ✌🏻💜</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

    "body": "Nov 2, 2023 - Today, 275lbs - 175lbs, 5’9”, 46yo\n\nI started gaining weight when I was 6 and never stopped. My parents were the “you’re going to eat rice cakes while the rest of us eat processed food” variety, which of course I learned to sneak and binge and hoard, early and often. I weighed 200lbs by the eighth grade and was 309 at my heaviest. \n\nI could talk about all the yo-yo diets and bs and blah blah but y’all know that part. I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis at 30, which had made any sort of exercise increasingly difficult. In the past few years, I’ve started to progress from relapsing remitting to secondary progressive, and lemme tell you, it’s some humbling shit. I use a walker now, because not only do weebles wobble but they most certainly DO fall down, and it fucking hurts. \n\nLast year my PCP said sort of off hand, “Hey, have you considered Wegovy?” which of course I hadn’t, because if you’ve ever suffered from any sort of chronic or long term condition you understand the feeling of sort of curling in on yourself to survive, which I was doing at that point. So we cleared it with my neuro, and it was off to the races. \n\nI’ve responded very well, but I’ve also paid the piper. Every dose increase causes vomiting which eventually evens out to a manageable nausea that never 100% goes away - but I smoke A LOT of weed (which all my doctors are aware of and support) which helps. I spent almost 5 months on 1.0 and am still only on 1.7… I don’t think I’ll ever move up. \n\nI got as much protein in as I should have, but because I don’t exercise I do have a lot of loose skin, but it’s not crazy and it’s certainly better than being overweight. I’ve been married to the same wonderful man who’s loved me through LITERAL thick and thin for 16 years and he doesn’t mind a bit. ",

      "selftext": "I am a female 5'5 and age 39. I have been on wegovy since April 2024. I was once 240lbs and now I am 145-150lbs. I started wegovy at about 220-225 I stayed at a low dose the entire year maxing out at 1mg. I am finally the size I was before pregnancy. I never though that I would get back to my old weight. I am so happy to finally share my results. I know I have a long journey of maintaining the weight loss and I will keep you posted because I am stopping in a month or so. Never give up! ",

I started wegovy at about 220-225 I stayed at a low dose the entire year maxing out at 1mg. I am finally the size I was before pregnancy. I never though that I would get back to my old weight. I am so happy to finally share my results. I know I have a long journey of maintaining the weight loss and I will keep you posted because I am stopping in a month or so. Never give up! </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

    "body": "I just wanted to post an update because I know this journey is a long one for most of us, and I hope this gives you the hope and motivation you need to stick with it.  It has taken me over 2 years to lose nearly 110lbs.  I was a VERY slow loser, and I started this journey eating low-carb and doing high intensity workouts 5 days a week.  Unlike in my 20s, the weight just would not come off quickly, even with Wegovy. But, for the first time in my life, I feel like this will actually stick because I have changed my life.  I eat fairly normal now (just less), I still workout 5 days a week, and I am more active than I have ever been.  My whole relationship with food has changed, and now I look at food as fuel, and even as something to enjoy, but more importantly, not something I obsess about.  I don’t think about my next meal while I am still eating my first, and I don’t dream of the food I used to binge eat when I wasn’t even hungry.  I feel NORMAL.  I am not going to say it’s all sunshine and roses, I will never have the flat stomach with abs that I have always dreamed about (shout out to aging, bad genetics, and loose skin).  I still sometimes even look in the mirror and see the 296 lb version of myself.  But the real reason I started this journey was to be the healthiest version of myself that I could be as I enter my 40s so I can be around longer for my kids, and play on the ground with my toddler, and go on hikes and adventures and just everything that I couldn’t do with the same enjoyment when I was so unhealthy. For the first time since I was 13, I am officially “normal” weight. If people ask, I tell them everything I have done without embarrassment or shame, and I encourage everyone who has struggled with this disease to give it a shot (literally).  It could be the game changer you need to be the healthiest version of you \n\nAge: 41\nHeight: 6’2”\nStarting Weight: 296\nOriginal Goal Weight: 200 \nNew Goal Weight: I stopped caring \nCurrent Weight: 189",

It has taken me over 2 years to lose nearly 110lbs.  I was a VERY slow loser, and I started this journey eating low-carb and doing high intensity workouts 5 days a week.  Unlike in my 20s, the weight just would not come off quickly, even with Wegovy. But, for the first time in my life, I feel like this will actually stick because I have changed my life.  I eat fairly normal now (just less), I still workout 5 days a week, and I am more active than I have ever been.  My whole relationship with food has changed, and now I look at food as fuel, and even as something to enjoy, but more importantly, not something I obsess about.  I don’t think about my next meal while I am still eating my first, and I don’t dream of the food I used to binge eat when I wasn’t even hungry.  I feel NORMAL.  I am not going to say it’s all sunshine and roses, I will never have the flat stomach with abs that I have always dreamed about (shout out to aging, bad genetics, and loose skin).  I still sometimes even look in the mirror and see the 296 lb version of myself.  But the real reason I started this journey was to be the healthiest version of myself that I could be as I enter my 40s so I can be around longer for my kids, and play on the ground with my toddler, and go on hikes and adventures and just everything that I couldn’t do with the same enjoyment when I was so unhealthy. For the first time since I was 13, I am officially “normal” weight. If people ask, I tell them everything I have done without embarrassment or shame, and I encourage everyone who has struggled with this disease to give it a shot (literally).  It could be the game changer you need to be the healthiest version of you </p>\n\n<p>Age: 41\nHeight: 6’2”\nStarting Weight: 296\nOriginal Goal Weight: 200 \nNew Goal Weight: I stopped caring \nCurrent Weight: 189</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

My Wegovy journey began last February. I was a relatively fast responder and, as of the last few months, losses have been slower, but when they do happen, they somehow feel more significant and my body feels the impact of them even more. I am still managing to lose despite the stressers of a (relatively) new job and free food everywhere. I&#39;ve lost the majority of this weight through Wegovy and it&#39;s been a huge relief to continuously keep losing it. I am on the highest dosage possible at this point.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

Skipping to a year later I weighed in at 132lbs, my liver is back to normal, my insulin went from an 18 to a 6,  My cholesterol is still mildly high (it runs in my family), a consistent 90/60 blood pressure almost too low at times! Lol, and my feet feel great. It will be 2 years on june 11th and I am still maintaining my weight at 135lbs taking the 1.7ml shot every 8 days. I never made it to the 2.7ml dose due to my weight being already where I wanted to be. My plan is to continue taking Wegovy as long as I can. It helps keep my blood sugar levels contained and my appetite comfortable. I’m glad to see a lot of other success stories on this reddit. I only take selfies so these full body pics of me and my horse will have to do Lol. ",

A lot of the frustration I see every day could be avoided with a better understanding of what’s normal.\n\nHere are 7 things I wish more people knew:\n\n1. **Your appetite drops, but it's not magic.** Emotional or habitual eating still takes work. Exercise takes work. It may be a little easier to do the work, but it's still work.\n2. **Weight loss isn’t linear.** Expect stalls and fluctuations. You might even gain weight here and there. That doesn’t mean it’s not working. \"Weight loss\" isn't the same as \"Fat loss.\"\n3. **Set realistic, healthy expectations.** Many are disappointed in not losing at least 5 pounds per week. ANY progress ***is*** progress. Anything around 1 pound per week or 0.5-2% body weight per week is wonderful.\n4. **Protein helps with everything.** Fullness, energy, and muscle retention all get easier when you're getting enough.\n5. **Side effects are common, but usually temporary.** Nausea, fatigue, constipation...they suck, but are often short-term.\n6. **You don’t need to be perfect.** Consistency beats perfection. The best results come from small habits and improving on them slightly week-over-week, not flipping your life upside down.\n7. **Mindset matters more than macros.** The people who win long-term break up big goals into little goals, identify ALL victories (not just on the scale), forgive themselves quickly and keep going.\n\nHappy to answer questions or expand on any of these. There’s a lot of noise out there. I want people to have real expectations and a better shot at long-term success. Either way, thank you for reading an I hope this helps!\n\n",

I knew I had gained around 38kg from 2021 to 2024 but I never realised that I had actually gone bigger lol. In my head I thought I was still slim. But seeing that photo I knew I had to do something. I struggled to lose weight in those years and just ended up putting on more. That’s when I wanted to get on wegovy. And it bought me back to the old me! I wanted to stay on wegovy maintenance up until December but due to low potassium, my doctor has taken me off it completely. I’m going to continue to eat clean (with occasional treats) and work on exercising more! But my journey with wegovy is finally over 🙂‍↕️</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

I’m happy with my weight now, just working on getting stronger.\n\nIn February, I decided to get a breast lift & implants to help resolve the saggy skin I had from the weight loss. So incredibly happy with my body now.\n\nSending everyone so much love and positive vibes for their journeys ❤️",

    "title": "Finally below 300",
    "body": "I just shared this post on my socials. You folks will understand....\n\n------------\n\n91 pounds difference.... Finally below 300. \n\nIn spring of 2023, I got to my top weight of 390. I promised myself I'd never get over 400 lbs, and decided to do something about it. \n\nIn the past, I'd done various weight loss plans and workout routines, but it was never sustainable, or I got bored with it, cut a toe off in a lawn mower, sat around during COVID, etc.... you know, the normal excuses. \n\nI decided to go to the doctor. I didn't want surgery. I have no issues with those who went that route, but it wasn't for me. The doctor referred me to the weight loss people at the hospital, and they wanted to put me on an 800 calorie a day plan, and if you don't make progress, they remove you from the program. I knew that wouldn't work for me. So the doctor and I agreed that I'd work on it myself before we looked at other options. \n\nOn my own, I got down to around 368 or so, and then we had a ton of life changes during the summer of 2023 that rearranged my entire lifestyle. \n\nWhen I went back to the doctor in early 2024, she agreed to put me on Wegovy, since I got back up to 378. \n\nFebruary 25 was my first time taking the meds, and I've been consistent in the gym 3 days a week. Sometimes I'll get in an extra day or so of exercise, and of course, some weeks might just be 2 days, but those are rare. I do a cardio day, an upper body day on weights, and a lower body day on weights. I do various machines, and found a routine that works for me. \n\nFor those of you thinking I'm cheating with the meds, I welcome you to join me in the gym. The meds help control my appetite, so I can slow down and think about what I'm eating, without just consuming enough for 3 people. I was never really a snacker, but I could put a buffet out of business!\n\nAdditionally, I had to address sleep apnea that came with the increased weight. I was using a C-pap for a while, but I don't need it anymore. My wife is very happy that I no longer snore! 😜\n\nSo for me, this has been how I've addressed the total physical package.... Sleeping well, eating better, and exercising consistently. I needed to create new habits that I can sustain. I do not plan to be on the meds forever. The numbers at the gym are going up, and the number on the scale is going down. This is working. \n\nMy goal is to get to 250 lbs and re-evaluate then. Back in 2008-2009, I got down to 280, but when I hurt my toe, I had to stop running on the treadmill. I don't know what 250 will look like on me. Last time I was there was 10th grade. I'm 6'3\", and to compare that weight to others, that's WWE wrestler Roman Reigns. Brock Lesnar is around 275. I don't think I'm gonna look like either of those guys, so I may have to adjust my goal to lose more or bulk more with weightlifting. We'll see. I'll update you all again when I'm closer to that size. \n\nIf you have questions, ask away. \n\n",

      "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I just shared this post on my socials. You folks will understand....</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>91 pounds difference.... Finally below 300. </p>\n\n<p>In spring of 2023, I got to my top weight of 390. I promised myself I&#39;d never get over 400 lbs, and decided to do something about it. </p>\n\n<p>In the past, I&#39;d done various weight loss plans and workout routines, but it was never sustainable, or I got bored with it, cut a toe off in a lawn mower, sat around during COVID, etc.... you know, the normal excuses. </p>\n\n<p>I decided to go to the doctor. I didn&#39;t want surgery. I have no issues with those who went that route, but it wasn&#39;t for me. The doctor referred me to the weight loss people at the hospital, and they wanted to put me on an 800 calorie a day plan, and if you don&#39;t make progress, they remove you from the program. I knew that wouldn&#39;t work for me. So the doctor and I agreed that I&#39;d work on it myself before we looked at other options. </p>\n\n<p>On my own, I got down to around 368 or so, and then we had a ton of life changes during the summer of 2023 that rearranged my entire lifestyle. </p>\n\n<p>When I went back to the doctor in early 2024, she agreed to put me on Wegovy, since I got back up to 378. </p>\n\n<p>February 25 was my first time taking the meds, and I&#39;ve been consistent in the gym 3 days a week. Sometimes I&#39;ll get in an extra day or so of exercise, and of course, some weeks might just be 2 days, but those are rare. I do a cardio day, an upper body day on weights, and a lower body day on weights. I do various machines, and found a routine that works for me. </p>\n\n<p>For those of you thinking I&#39;m cheating with the meds, I welcome you to join me in the gym. The meds help control my appetite, so I can slow down and think about what I&#39;m eating, without just consuming enough for 3 people. I was never really a snacker, but I could put a buffet out of business!</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, I had to address sleep apnea that came with the increased weight. I was using a C-pap for a while, but I don&#39;t need it anymore. My wife is very happy that I no longer snore! 😜</p>\n\n<p>So for me, this has been how I&#39;ve addressed the total physical package.... Sleeping well, eating better, and exercising consistently. I needed to create new habits that I can sustain. I do not plan to be on the meds forever. The numbers at the gym are going up, and the number on the scale is going down. This is working. </p>\n\n<p>My goal is to get to 250 lbs and re-evaluate then. Back in 2008-2009, I got down to 280, but when I hurt my toe, I had to stop running on the treadmill. I don&#39;t know what 250 will look like on me. Last time I was there was 10th grade. I&#39;m 6&#39;3&quot;, and to compare that weight to others, that&#39;s WWE wrestler Roman Reigns. Brock Lesnar is around 275. I don&#39;t think I&#39;m gonna look like either of those guys, so I may have to adjust my goal to lose more or bulk more with weightlifting. We&#39;ll see. I&#39;ll update you all again when I&#39;m closer to that size. </p>\n\n<p>If you have questions, ask away. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

I was 150 kg, in a marriage that was not healthy for neither me nor my (now ex)partner, and on top of that I also suffered from serious skin problems. I hated pictures of myself, so there are not many full figure photos from that period. I took this to model the first sweater I knitted, size xxl and still a little bit too tight for comfort. </p>\n\n<p>I had bariatric surgery in November 2020. Lost quite a bit of weight, but startet gaining again after two years. In March 2024 I startet Wegovy. Now, I’m almost half the weight I was before my journey started. I’m divorced, happy, active, and my skin has cleared up! Two days ago I bought a secondhand dress, size medium! I almost didn’t try it on, because I was certain it would never fit, but my friend persuaded me. </p>\n\n<p>I haven’t become a better person from losing all this weight, but I absolutely live a better life! And hopefully, me being happy in my life, gives me a better foundation to spread some of that happibess around. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
