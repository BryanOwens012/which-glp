I wore most of my clothes until I absolutely couldn’t anymore and they were falling off, then when I finally did buy stuff I also grew out of it super quickly. I tailored stuff back in Nov that is now falling off lol. It was just super hard to find in between stuff. Maybe now that I’m at the weight I’m going to maintain it’ll be a little easier? Definitely plan to still tailor stuff (denim shorts, skirts especially and jeans). But honestly shopping as a plus sized person was so much easier bc I knew how stuff would fit for the most part!
