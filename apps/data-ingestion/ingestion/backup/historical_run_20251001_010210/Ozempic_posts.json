    "body": "Here are some wild before and current pictures. I started on wegovy in August 2023 and moved to ozempic for insurance reasons. I’m 5’3” and my starting weight was 271. I’ve lost 136lbs and made it to the weight I’m going to maintain, 135lbs, right before vacation last week. \n\nHappy to answer any questions! But here are the things I’ve seen people ask / talk about over the last year and a half: \n\nYes I work out. I’m the person saying I workout 7 days a week 2x a day. I plan to continue this through maintenance. I also cut out a lot of foods and didn’t drink for 1 year and 4 months. I did have a couple drinks on vacation but still can’t get drunk or buzzed. I don’t think booze will be part of my life while I’m in maintenance for this reason, and I was formerly an enthusiastic social drinker. I’m going to lose 10 more lbs before I talk to my doctor about a maintenance dose so I have that wiggle room to figure out what dose will be best. Yes I’ve lost a ton of hair, NO I’m not any healthier or happier. I’m not a “completely different person” so although you may mean well you can respectfully keep those comments to yourself 🖤! I am still all about fat liberation and total body neutrality.  \n\nSocially no one treats me any different. No one has made any weird comments about my body or weight loss. Dating isn’t any better, I def pulled more dudes as a class III obese person. Physically I don’t feel any different, but I didn’t have any mobility issues previously. \n\nThat’s it! Again feel free to ask any questions! Hopefully this is helpful and best of luck to everyone, you got this! ",

I’m 5’3” and my starting weight was 271. I’ve lost 136lbs and made it to the weight I’m going to maintain, 135lbs, right before vacation last week. </p>\n\n<p>Happy to answer any questions! But here are the things I’ve seen people ask / talk about over the last year and a half: </p>\n\n<p>Yes I work out. I’m the person saying I workout 7 days a week 2x a day. I plan to continue this through maintenance. I also cut out a lot of foods and didn’t drink for 1 year and 4 months. I did have a couple drinks on vacation but still can’t get drunk or buzzed. I don’t think booze will be part of my life while I’m in maintenance for this reason, and I was formerly an enthusiastic social drinker. I’m going to lose 10 more lbs before I talk to my doctor about a maintenance dose so I have that wiggle room to figure out what dose will be best. Yes I’ve lost a ton of hair, NO I’m not any healthier or happier. I’m not a “completely different person” so although you may mean well you can respectfully keep those comments to yourself 🖤! I am still all about fat liberation and total body neutrality.  </p>\n\n<p>Socially no one treats me any different. No one has made any weird comments about my body or weight loss. Dating isn’t any better, I def pulled more dudes as a class III obese person. Physically I don’t feel any different, but I didn’t have any mobility issues previously. </p>\n\n<p>That’s it! Again feel free to ask any questions! Hopefully this is helpful and best of luck to everyone, you got this! </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
